    <p>
      This section is brief a introduction describing how things are
      organized.
    </p>

    <subsection id="devguide-source-organisation"> <!--{{{-->
      <title>Source code</title>

      <p>
        The source code is organized into the following three layers:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li><em>core</em> in <tt>src/core/</tt>. This is the base
          library written in C containing very basic functionality. This
          includes a generic hash table, a generic list, a safe
          growing-buffer implementation, lightweight type conversions,
          etc. This is considered legacy and contains all
          implementations which do <em>not</em> deal with e-mail (and
          related topics) or the user interface(s) (and related topics.)
          This is eventually to be separated into an souvereign project,
          maybe. The API already is designed a little towards
          <tt>libowfat</tt> so that a future migratation will be not so
          painful. The migration isn't done as the first step in the
          rewrite process since we're focusing on the core (logic)
          design and not on efficient sanity wrappers for system
          functions.</li>

        <li><em>libmuttng</em> in <tt>src/libmuttng/</tt>. This is the core
          part of the whole project as it contains most of the mail logic. It
          will provide one simple interface to mail storage independent from
          ``details'' like whether the actual storage is IMAP, POP3, NNTP or
          local storage methods such as Maildir or MBOX, whether there's
          support for a local cache or not, etc. Even the fact that some
          storage or transport methods may use network connections (thus
          involving encryption and authentication features, for example), will
          be be hidden from the application's point of view to achieve maximum
          portability and transparency. Also, it will contain transparent
          MIME-handling including digital encryption and signing, content types
          and handlers, etc. Besides these two major features, it'll provide
          utility classes and functions not at all related to mail but useful
          for the library and application implementation like a centralized
          debug output interface and generic signal handling.</li>

        <li><em>muttng</em> in <tt>src/muttng/</tt>. Built on top of the
          <em>core</em> and <em>libmuttng</em> layers, this group represents
          user interfaces and everything related. This includes support for
          reading configuration files, presenting data provided by the two
          underlying layers, etc. It will provide a convenient way to write new
          binaries with few code having access to all mail-related tasks. It
          will be split into two major parts: the actual user interface on side
          and all common logic (configuration, mail logic, etc.) on the other
          so that user interfaces only have to implement presenting data and
          nothing more.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>
        A very important design goal to keep by any means is the
        relationship between these three layers:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>core</em> must not depend on or make any kind of
          assumptions about either <em>libmuttng</em> or
          <em>muttng</em>. It may only rely on the standard C
          library.</li>
        <li><em>libmuttng</em> must not depend on or make any kind of
          assumptions about <em>muttng</em> but may utilize
          <em>core</em> and yet not make assumptions about how it
          internally works.</li>
        <li><em>muttng</em> may use any library it finds useful but, as
          all parts, must not make assumptions about internal
          implementation details or choices.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The reason for this separation is to have good information
        hiding and a modular structure not only within these parts but
        also between them. As our main intention is to write a
        mail <em>user</em> agent, we move as much mail logic as possible
        out to libmuttng which then will be split into a separate
        project as core will be, too. In the end, mutt-ng is supposed to
        be a flexible client just using powerful libraries without
        implementing much logic itself.
      </p>

      <title>Documentation</title>

      <p>
        All documentation in all places is written in a custom XML
        dialect to be translated via XSL into all other formats we need.
        These include DocBook as well as <man>doxygen</man>-based
        documentation. Language-independent parts are put in a separate
        directory and automated mechanisms for validity and completeness
        checks will be provided to ensure correct translated documentation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The basic organization is this:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li>The ``master'' documentation is English. Where appropriate (see
          below), it'll be auto-generated and validated from the source code to
          avoid out-of-sync problems as far as possible.</li>

        <li>New is the goal to have all parts split over several files rather
          than only one big file. All files have to be valid XML and are checked
          for validity and completenes (where appropriate.)</li>

        <li>The basic manual structure for both, the user-only manual and this
          developer manual, is placed in <tt>doc/common/</tt> which contains
          other language-independent parts. For every language supported, upon
          change these will be copied to the language directories to have them
          under version control, too, on the one hand and to ease (the release)
          build process for users.</li>

      </ul>

      <title>Build system</title>

      <p>
        The build system is completely GNU make-based so that use of the autotools
        (such as <man>autoconf</man>) is avoided. To avoid clashes and misleading
        error messages with other flavors of <man>make</man>, all Makefiles are named
        <tt>GNUmakefile</tt> so that other make tools don't even find a Makefile.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the top-level source directory there're Makefile written for inclusion:
        they contain common logic, targets and rules as well as functions.
      </p>

      <p>
        These include Makefiles have to be included in all other Makefiles as necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        All Makefiles are under version control except a custom one where users can
        set their own options (and any other make construct.) to avoid subversion conflicts
        if we change something.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's a common set of targets every Makefile in any directory must implement
        so that we have targets working for the whole tree.

      <p>
        This only runs <man>doxygen</man> it it's found in <env>PATH</env>. If, in addition,
        <man>tidy</man> is found too, it'll also be called. If doxygen isn't present,

      <p>
        The include Makefile <tt>GNUmakefile.whereis</tt> defines a

        For example, the full path to <man>vi</man> can be obtained via:

      <pre>
GREAT_EDITOR := $(call whereis,vi,)</pre>

      <p>
        If the binary is found, <tt>GREAT_EDITOR</tt> will contain its path and

somerule:
ifneq ($(GREAT_EDITOR),)
        $(GREAT_EDITOR) [options]

GREAT_EDITOR := $(call whereis,vim,vi)</pre>

      <p>
        ...which will search for the <man>vim</man> binary: if it's found,

        All sectioning tags <em>must</em> have an <tt>id</tt> attribute with

      </p>

      <ul>

        <li><em>(cross-)referencing</em>. For making any type of references, the followin
          tags are to be used:
          <ul>
            <li><tt>email</tt>: an email address</li>
            <li><tt>web</tt>: a web address</li>
            <li><tt>varref</tt>: referencing a configuration variable</li>
            <li><tt>cmdref</tt>: referencing a configuration command</li>
            <li><tt>funcref</tt>: referencing a function</li>
            <li><tt>man</tt>: referencing a manual page. Optionally,
              it may contain a <tt>sect</tt> attribute to specify the
              section. If none given, 1 will be used by default.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><em>special semantics</em>. There will be much more, but currently
          the following tags are to be used for specifying a special semantic
          for a word (mainly these are needed for auto-indexing so that
          one can actually find something in the documentation):
          <ul>
            <li><tt>val</tt>: when refering to (possible/default/...) values
              for variables.</li>
            <li><tt>hdr</tt>: when refering to a commonly used header</li>
            <li><tt>enc</tt>: when refering to transport encodings (such
              as <enc>quoted-printable</enc> or <enc>us-ascii</enc></li>
            <li><tt>env</tt>: when refering to environment variables</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><em>listings</em>. To specify lists or listings, the following tags
          are available:
          <ul>
            <li><tt>ul</tt>: a non-numbered itemized list</li>
            <li><tt>li</tt>: an item of any of these lists</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><em>misc.</em>: The following are not the optimal solution as they
          imply layout semantics already but here we go:
          <ul>
            <li><tt>tt</tt>: typewriter font</li>
            <li><tt>em</tt>: emphasise</li>
            <li><tt>b</tt>: bold font</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p>
        Internally, variables are documented like this (this does <em>not</em> count for
        the description of a variable but the variable as a whole within the
        manual) (<em>note: this is auto-generated</em>):
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>all variables are wrapped within a <tt>descriptions</tt> tag</li>
        <li>within this, there's any number of <tt>variable</tt> tags containing
          the following attributes: <tt>name</tt> specifies the name of the
          variable, <tt>type</tt> specifies its type</li>
        <li>within a <tt>variable</tt> tag, the following tags will be used:
          <ul>
            <li><tt>init</tt>: initial or default value</li>
            <li><tt>sig</tt>: whether a change of it will cause a signal be emitted</li>
            <li><tt>descr</tt>: its description</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Internally, functions are documented like this
        (<em>note: this is auto-generated</em>):
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>all functions are wrapped within a <tt>descriptions</tt> tag</li>
        <li>within this, there's any number of <tt>context</tt> tags containing
          the following attributes: <tt>name</tt> specifies the name of the
          context. As functions are grouped by context (that is: by menu) where
          they may have different bindings, each function may appear several
          times within different <tt>context</tt> tags.</li>
        <li>within the <tt>context</tt> tag, all functions it contains are
          given via <tt>function</tt> tags. Each <tt>function</tt> tag must contain the
          following attributes: <tt>name</tt> specifies the name a user
          may bind to it, <tt>default</tt> specifies the default key binding
          and <tt>group</tt> specifies to which semantic group the function belongs
          within the context.</li>
        <li>the text within the <tt>function</tt> tag is just the functions's
          (English) summary to appear in the help menus</li>
      </ul>

      <title>Features</title>

      <p>
        Libmuttng is in the <tt>src/libmuttng/</tt> subdirectory
        and provides the following features:
      </p>

      <ul>

        <li><em>basic services</em> of interest for the whole library and
          application: signal handling and debug support.</li>

        <li><em>mailbox support</em> includes: IMAP, POP3, NNTP, Maildir, MH,
          MBOX and MMDF. The Mailbox abstraction layer works transparently and is
          URL-driven, that is, the client doesn't need to care about and that
          there are different storage formats</li>

        <li><em>caching</em> is transparent for some mailbox types: IMAP, NNTP,
          Maildir and MH. Again, as the Mailbox layer is abstract, so is the
          caching layer which means that clients don't take note of caching
          existing.</li>

        <li><em>MIME and crypto</em> support via either local utilities such as
          <man>pgp</man>/<man>gpg</man> or via gpgme for crypto and support for
          the mailcap mechanism, using <man>file</man> and the like. Decoding
          will be transparent for client, too.</li>

      </ul>

    <subsection id="devguide-libmuttng-signal"> <!--{{{-->
      <title>Signal handling</title>

      <p>
        Libmuttng contains a very simple, easy to use and typesafe signal
        handling interface. Though signals will be used within the library,
        too, it's use is not limited to connecting handlers in the client
        to events in the library but may also be used to pass signals
        only within the client.
      </p>

      <p>
        We started off with the implementation from:
        <web>http://lists.trolltech.com/qt-interest/1997-07/msg00158.html</web>
        and extended/modified it to fit our needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Declaring</em> a signal is as easy as:
      </p>

      <pre>
SignalX&lt;type of arg1,type of arg2,...,type of argX&gt; signalname;</pre>

      <p>
        whereby <tt>X</tt> is the number of arguments. An example may be:
      </p>

      <pre>
Signal1&lt;Mailbox*&gt; mailboxHasNewMail;</pre>

      <p>
        saying that all handlers will get one argument being a pointer to a
        Mailbox class instance.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Connecting</em> to a signal is easy, too. Each handler must fullfill
        the following two requirements:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>it must return <tt>bool</tt> specifying whether it succeeded
          or not</li>
        <li>it must take exactly the number and type of arguments the
          signal was declared with</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For the above example, given a class <tt>foo</tt> with a method
        <tt>bool foo::bar(Mailbox* mailbox)</tt>, connecting to the
        signal is as easy as:
      </p>

      <pre>
connectSignal (someObject.mailboxHasNewMail, this, &amp;foo::bar);</pre>

      <p>
        <em>Emitting</em> a signal can be done by every method having access to
        the signal's declaration and works like this:
      </p>

      <pre>
this.mailboxHasNewMail.emit (this);</pre>

      <p>
        ...assuming the signal is defined in a Mailbox class.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a given signal, all handlers are executed in some order while
        each of them returns success. As soon as one handlers reports failure,
        the emit process will abort.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Disconnecting</em> from a signal is highly recommended to take
        place in the object's destructor as a crash upon the next emit after
        destruction is likely. Though any object may connect as many handlers as it
        likes to a signal, it's currently only supported to unbind all
        handlers of an object <em>for a specific signal</em> at once like so:
      </p>

      <pre>
disconnectSignals (someObject.mailboxHasNewMail, this);</pre>

      <p>
        This must be done for every signal the object connected a(ny) handler(s)
        to.
      </p>

      <title>Auto-generated code</title>

      <p>
        <em>Signal implementation.</em> As unfortunately we cannot overload
        templates by the number of arguments, we need to specify the same
        implementation for every argument count we need. Thus, this is done by
        a script: <tt>src/libmuttng/signal.pl</tt> prints the commented
        implementation to <tt>stdout</tt> so that the makefile puts it into
        <tt>muttng_signal.h</tt>. When making changes, modify muttng_signal.h to verify it
        works (plus maybe add a unit test) and adjust signal.pl to print the
        changed code.
