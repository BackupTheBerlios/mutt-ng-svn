    <title>Supported systems</title>

    <p>
      Mutt-ng is known to work on the following systems:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Linux: gcc</li>
      <li>FreeBSD: 5.x with gcc 3.4/4.0</li>

    <title>Build Requirements</title>

    <p>      
      For building mutt-ng, you need to have the following software installed
      and working:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>GNU make. Others won't work as the makefiles use GNU make-only constructs.</li>
      <li>A C and C++ compiler. Currently supported are the GNU Compiler Collection and
        Sun Microsystems' workshop pro compiler suite.</li>
      <li>Perl 5.</li>
      <li>Optionally, for building and running the unit tests, Unit++ (see
        <web>http://unitpp.sf.net/</web>) must be installed.</li>
      <li>Optionally, for building localized versions of the applications,
        GNU gettext is required to be installed.</li>
      <li>Optionally, for encrypted connections, either OpenSSL or GNUTLS is
        required.</li>
      <li>Though technically optional it's higly recommended to have
        libiconv installed which is used for conversions between
        different characte sets/encodings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For building muttng's homepage as well as the manual, the following tools must be
      installed and setup properly:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>XSL processor. Currently only <tt>xsltproc</tt> and <tt>xalan</tt> are supported
        whereby <tt>xalan</tt> has problems with XInclude still to be resolved.</li>
      <li>DocBook stylesheets for version 4.3.</li>
      <li>A LaTeX system including <man>pdflatex</man>, <man>latex</man> and
        <man>makeindex</man></li>.
    </ul>

    <p>
      In addition, for building the source code's documentation,
      <man>doxygen</man> (see <web>http://www.doxygen.org/</web>) is required.
    </p>

    <title>Build Configuration</title>

    <p>
      In the top-level directory, there's a file named <tt>configure.pl</tt>
      which configures the build process. Just run it with the preferred set
      of options, a full list is available when running it with the 
      <tt>--help</tt> option.
    </p>

  <section id="build-app"> <!--{{{-->
    <title>Building applications</title>

    <p>
      Building the main applications should be as easy as the following steps:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>run <tt>configure.pl</tt></li>
      <li>If it didn't stop with an error (what shouldn't happen), run
        <pre>
$ make depend</pre>
        in the top-level directory.</li>
      <li>If everything still succeeded, just run <tt>make</tt> to build
        everything.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      If any of these steps fails, please notify the developers via
      <email>mutt-ng-devel@lists.berlios.de</email>.
