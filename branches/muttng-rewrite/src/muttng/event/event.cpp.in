 *
 *   @section muttng_event_intro Introduction
 *
 *     Event handling is one of the most or even the most important part
 *     of the UI built on top of libmuttng since many many things are
 *     now done with simple event handling:
 *
 *       - implementation of all hooks
 *       - user interface notification upon configuration changes
 *       - screen switches
 *       - all function handling and binding
 *       - all @c bind and @c macro implementations
 *       - ...
 *
 *     The implementation is based on the following concepts:
 *
 *       -# There are so called "contexts", that is a semantic grouping
 *          of events. Currently these are the former screens/menus, but
 *          other contexts may follow. Contexts are remembered using a
 *          stack to centralize the context switching within the event
 *          handler.
 *       -# There are events, that is simply a numeric ID to which any
 *          handler within the application can be bound (since an event
 *          handler is a property of Muttng and all application classes
 *          must be derived from it, all classes have access to the
 *          event handler.) Any piece of
 *          code can demand the central event handler to release a specific
 *          event which will then notify all handlers. This way the
 *          logic and many parts are really de-coupled.
 *       -# In addition to these, for user interfaces, events are also
 *          sorted into groups. For example, a user interface could want
 *          to sort functions by semantic instead of only by assigned
 *          keys.
 *
 *   @section muttng_event_context Context (stack)
 *
 *     The stack needs to be organized as a stack to de-couple different
 *     parts. As certain parts may want to perform some action upon a
 *     context switch, there must be an event for it. However, when only
 *     knowing about the current context, the part triggering the switch
 *     would have to save the old context to release a re-entering of the
 *     old context after leaving the new one. To centralize this within
 *     the event handler itself, there's a stack. The current context
 *     can be set and unset with Event::setContext() and
 *     Event::unsetContext() and the event handler will release the
 *     following events on its own:
 *
 *       -# Event::setContext() will release Event::E_CONTEXT_ENTER and
 *          push the new context on the stack.
 *       -# Event::unsetContext() will first release Event::E_CONTEXT_LEAVE,
 *          of course, and pop the context we're leaving. If afterwards
 *          the stack is not empty, it will release
 *          Event::E_CONTEXT_REENTER.
 *
 *     This approach is useful in implementing a <code>context-hook</code>
 *     triggered upon Event::E_CONTEXT_ENTER and
 *     Event::E_CONTEXT_REENTER. This can be used, for example, like
 *     this:
 *
 *     <pre>
 * context-hook . '&lt;enter-command&gt;set sidebar_width=20&lt;enter&gt;'
 * context-hook help '&lt;enter-command&gt;unset sidebar_width&lt;enter&gt;'</pre>
 *
 *     to turn off the sidebar when viewing the help screen.
 *
 *     The Event::C_GENERIC is special, since even if there's no handler
 *     for an event of the current context, the event for the generic
 *     context will always be tried.
 *
 *   @section muttng_event_event Events
 *
 *     There're basically only two types of events:
 *
 *       -# Internal events. These include the context switches, a
 *          configuration change, etc. In fact this is everything except
 *          the second group.
 *       -# User events. These are the former functions.
 *
 *   @section muttng_event_impl Implementation
 *
 *     @subsection muttng_event_impl_ov Overhead
 *
 *       To reduce overhead as far as possible, we take the big table
 *       approach: Event::handlers is a multi-dimensional table mapping
 *       an event of a context to a list of handlers to be called. This
 *       ensures we have O(1) access to all handlers. Also the table
 *       size is constant except for the list of handlers, of course.
 *       The drawback is that certrain events aren't valid in all
 *       contexts so that this wastes memory.
 *
 *     @subsection muttng_event_impl_bind Binding
 *
 *       As the lookup for the arrays works in O(1), there's not really
 *       much overhead for binding.
 *
 *       Unfortunately, we cannot register dynamic (i.e. non-static)
 *       members of an object as the callback handler. The solution
 *       currently is pretty dangrous: when using Event::bindInternal(),
 *       the caller must provide a self pointer of type
 *       <code>void*</code>. This is the pointer to <code>this</code>
 *       casted to <code>void*</code>. The handler must cast it back to
 *       a pointer of the object type it is part of. This way, the
 *       handler has access to non-static members. This can be pretty
 *       dangerous but enables us to have all tables constant by means
 *       of size.
 *
 *       Pretty dangerous, too, is the way data is passed. A handler can
 *       only be used to catch one type event since the data passed to
 *       handlers depends on the actual event. Everything is casted to
 *       <code>unsigned long</code>. Of course, the handler gets told
 *       for which event of which context it was called so it could do
 *       distinction when casting data back to its original form...
 *
 *       That the whole binding isn't really typesafe but requires lots
 *       of care is something which needs to be improved. At best, we
 *       keep O(1) access and even reduce memory waste.
 *
 *       The type of data passed on events is:
 *
 *         - Event::E_CONTEXT_ENTER, Event::E_CONTEXT_LEAVE,
 *           Event::E_CONTEXT_REENTER: <code>0</code>
 *         - Event::E_OPTION_CHANGE: <code>option_t*</code>
 *         - Event::E_HELP: <code>0</code>
 *
 *     @subsection muttng_event_bind_hacking Hacking
 *
 *       As the order of elements stored in tables matters, the source
 *       being compiled is created automatically by the
 *       <code>event.pl</code> script in the <code>muttng/event/</code>
 *       directory. It reads the files
 *       <code>muttng/event/CONTEXTS</code>,
 *       <code>muttng/event/EVENTS</code> and 
 *       <code>muttng/event/GROUPS</code> and replaces magic words in
 *       <code>event.cpp.in</code> and <code>event.h.in</code>
 *       respectively. Doxygen documentation is created, too.
 *
 *       <b>When making changes to the implementation, do them in the
 *       latter two files only!</b>
 *
 *       The magic words are (with one more trailing and one more
 *       leading underscore [replacement is done via regex so we
 *       we would get in trouble here...]):
 *
 *         -# @c _CONTEXT_ENUM_ builds up Event::context
 *         -# @c _EVENT_ENUM_ builds up Event::event
 *         -# @c _GROUP_ENUM_ builds up Event::group
 *         -# @c _CONTEXT__DESCR_ builds up CtxStr
 *         -# @c _EVENT_DESCR_ builds up EvStr
 *         -# @c _GROUP_DESCR_ builds up GroupStr
 *         -# @c _EVENT_VALID_ builds up EvValid
 *         -# @c _GROUP_VALID_ builds up GroupValid
 *         -# @c _EVENT_HELP_ builds up EvHelp
 *       
 *       In addition, @c _BIND_ produces the code to setup the default
 *       bindings for functions, i.e. the bindings array.
 *
 *       <code>CONTEXTS</code>, <code>muttng/event/GROUPS</code> and
 *       <code>EVENTS</code> contain simple space-separated fields.
 *
 *       The fields of <code>CONTEXTS</code> have the following meaning:
 *
 *         -# context ID for Event::context (i.e. <code>C_GENERIC</code>)
 *         -# context description for the @c bind and @c macro features
 *
 *       Similarily, the fileds of <code>GROUPS</code> have the
 *       following meaning:
 *
 *         -# group ID for Event::group (i.e. <code>G_INTERNAL</code>)
 *         -# group description the fancy help screens
 *
 *       The fields of <code>EVENTS</code> have the followin meaning:
 *
 *         -# @c OR'ed context ID for which the event is valid to be
 *            store in EvValid. There must be no space between |.
 *            Example: <code>C_INDEX|C_PAGER|...</code> for
 *            <code>&lt;help&gt;</code> which is valid in all screens
 *            except help due to looping.
 *         -# event ID for Event::event (i.e. <code>E_HELP</code>)
 *         -# the function name for the event the user can bind to or
 *            @c NULL if none, i.e. the event is internal.
 *         -# the group ID of the event (use @c G_INTERNAL for all
 *            non-functions)
 *         -# the default key binding for functions and @c NULL
 *            otherwise.
 *         -# the description of a function for the help screen and
 *            manual and @c NULL for internal events.
 *
 *       This format currently implies that a function must always have
 *       the same default keybinding for all contexts it's valid in.
 *
 *     @subsection muttng_event_bind_usage Using the event handler
 *
 *       It can be used in the following ways:
 *
 *         -# bind to and thus catch any event
 *         -# release any event
 *         -# query for listings of events
 *
 *       The first is achieved via the @c bind* functions.
 *
 *       The second is achieved via the release() function.
 *
 *       For the third, here are some usage scenarios:
 *
 *         - a full listing (including everything application-interal,
 *           i.e. non-functions) can be obtained via getHelp() and
 *           looping over Event::context and Event::event
 *         - @c muttng-conf(1) uses filters available: it retrieves a
 *           list of valid groups for every context. While ignoring
 *           @c G_INTERNAL, it retrieves the list of all known events
 *           for all groups it got. For every event, it then uses
 *           getHelp() to get data to display.
