RfC 3676 defining format=flowed
===============================

This RfC specifies quote chars to be '>' and due to space-stuffing lines
there're no spaces withing the quote prefix of a line allowed.
Currently, the implementation does:

- Change all quote characters by force to '>'. This is plain wrong in
  some cases where a character from $quote_regexp (even with the default
  setting) may appear at the beginning of a line but actually doesn't
  represent a quoted line. For example, someone may quote parts of
  muttng configs with comments. However, _if_ this _is_ a quoted line
  using e.g. '#' as $indent_string, we need to change the '#' prefix to
  '>'.

- Compress the complete quote, i.e. remove any spaces within the
  complete quote prefix of a line. This, too, is just plain wrong. For
  example, some people may have $indent_string set to '> ' and this gets
  quoted several times to something like '>> >>'. However this
  semanticly has a quote level of 3 as the second poster space-stuffed
  that line. IMHO it's more common that people use spaces in
  $indent_string (which the implementation removes right now) than
  people space-stuffing lines which start '>' to ' >' when composing new
  messages.
