This document lists bug known to exist in mutt-ng which are more less
difficult to fix.

RfC 3676 defining format=flowed
===============================

Muttng currently lacks correct dealing with quote prefixes in some
cases, i.e. when converting from format=fixed to format=flowed. One
problem is that $quote_regexp only specifies the complete quote sequence
instead of just one level. Second, quoting characters seen in the wild
like '|' or '#' are part of the default $quote_regexp but may also be
used to mark certain things like writing about examples or the like in
messages. Muttng does not do any guessing so that it's up to the user to
ensure correct quoting.

Altough the standard enforces space-stuffing as a MUST, muttng
currently violates it. Space-stuffing is done _once_ after initially
editing the message. The routine only handles '^From ' and '^ ' cases,
'^>' is ignored. (Once because an already space-stuffed line still has
a leading space so that it would get space-stuffed everytime the user
edits a message.)
