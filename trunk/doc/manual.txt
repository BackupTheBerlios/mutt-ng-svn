       MMuutttt--nngg is a small but very powerful text-based MIME mail client.  Mutt-ng is
       highly configurable, and is well suited to the mail power user with advanced
       features like key bindings, keyboard macros, mail threading, regular expression
       searches and a powerful pattern matching language for selecting groups of mes-
       sages.

       This documentation additionally contains documentation to MMuutttt--NNGG, a fork from
       Mutt with the goal to fix all the little annoyances of Mutt, to integrate all
       the Mutt patches that are floating around in the web, and to add other new fea-
       tures. Features specific to Mutt-ng will be discussed in an extra section.
       Don't be confused when most of the documentation talk about Mutt and not Mutt-
       ng, Mutt-ng contains all Mutt features, plus many more.

       This section is intended as a brief overview of how to use Mutt-ng.  There are
       many other features which are described elsewhere in the manual.  <-- There is
       even more information available in the Mutt FAQ and various web pages.  See the
       Mutt Page for more details.  -->

       The key bindings described in this section are the defaults as distributed.
       Your local system administrator may have altered the defaults for your site.
       You can always type ``?'' in any menu to display the current bindings.

       The first thing you need to do is invoke mutt-ng simply by typing muttng at the
       command line.  There are various command-line options, see either the muttng
       man page or the _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e (section 6.1  , page 62).

       If you have used mutt in the past the easiest thing to have a proper configura-
       tion file is to source  /.muttrc in  /.muttngrc.

       Information is presented in menus, very similar to ELM.  Here is a table show-
       ing the common keys used to navigate menus in Mutt-ng.

       Mutt-ng has a builtin line editor which is used as the primary way to input
       textual data such as email addresses or filenames.  The keys used to move
       around while editing are very similar to those of Emacs.

            ^A or <Home>    bol             move to the start of the line
            ^B or <Left>    backward-char   move back one char
            Esc B          backward-word  move back one word
            ^D or <Delete>  delete-char     delete the char under the cursor
            ^E or <End>     eol             move to the end of the line
            ^F or <Right>   forward-char    move forward one char
            Esc F          forward-word   move forward one word
            <Tab>           complete        complete filename or alias
            ^T              complete-query  complete address with query
            ^K              kill-eol        delete to the end of the line
            ESC d          kill-eow  delete to the end of the word
            ^W              kill-word       kill the word in front of the cursor
            ^U              kill-line       delete entire line
            ^V              quote-char      quote the next typed key
            <Up>            history-up      recall previous string from history
            <Down>          history-down    recall next string from history
            <BackSpace>     backspace       kill the char in front of the cursor
            Esc u          upcase-word    convert word to upper case
            Esc l          downcase-word  convert word to lower case
            Esc c          capitalize-word capitalize the word
            ^G              n/a             abort
            <Return>        n/a             finish editing

       You can remap the _e_d_i_t_o_r functions using the _b_i_n_d (section 3.3  , page 17) com-
       mand.  For example, to make the _D_e_l_e_t_e key delete the character in front of the
       cursor rather than under, you could use

       bind editor <delete> backspace

       Similar to many other mail clients, there are two modes in which mail is read
       in Mutt-ng.  The first is the index of messages in the mailbox, which is called
       the ``index'' in Mutt-ng.  The second mode is the display of the message con-
       tents.  This is called the ``pager.''

       The next few sections describe the functions provided in each of these modes.

       In addition to who sent the message and the subject, a short summary of the
       disposition of each message is printed beside the message number.  Zero or more
       of the following ``flags'' may appear, which mean:

             D
                   message is deleted (is marked for deletion)

             d
                   message have attachments marked for deletion

             K
                   contains a PGP public key

             !
                   message is flagged

             *
                   message is tagged

       Some of the status flags can be turned on or off using

          +o sseett--ffllaagg (default: w)

          +o cclleeaarr--ffllaagg (default: W)

       Furthermore, the following flags reflect who the message is addressed to.  They
       can be customized with the _$_t_o___c_h_a_r_s (section 6.3.320  , page 143) variable.

       By default, Mutt-ng uses its builtin pager to display the body of messages.
       The pager is very similar to the Unix program _l_e_s_s though not nearly as fea-
       tureful.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                     6

            <Return>        go down one line
            <Space>         display the next page (or next message if at the end of a message)
            -               go back to the previous page
            n               search for next match
            S               skip beyond quoted text
            T               toggle display of quoted text
            ?               show key bindings
            /               search for a regular expression (pattern)
            ESC /           search backwards for a regular expression
            \               toggle search pattern coloring
            ^               jump to the top of the message

       In addition, many of the functions from the _i_n_d_e_x are available in the pager,
       such as _d_e_l_e_t_e_-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e or _c_o_p_y_-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e (this is one advantage over using an
       external pager to view messages).

       Also, the internal pager supports a couple other advanced features. For one, it
       will accept and translate the ``standard'' nroff sequences for bold and under-
       line. These sequences are a series of either the letter, backspace (^H), the
       letter again for bold or the letter, backspace, ``_'' for denoting underline.
       Mutt-ng will attempt to display these in bold and underline respectively if
       your terminal supports them. If not, you can use the bold and underline _c_o_l_o_r
       (section 3.7  , page 21) objects to specify a color or mono attribute for them.

       Additionally, the internal pager supports the ANSI escape sequences for charac-
       ter attributes.  Mutt-ng translates them into the correct color and character
       settings.  The sequences Mutt-ng supports are:

            ESC [ Ps;Ps;Ps;...;Ps m
            where Ps =
            0    All Attributes Off
            1    Bold on
            4    Underline on
            5    Blink on
            7    Reverse video on
            3x   Foreground color is x
            4x   Background color is x

            Colors are
            0    black
            1    red
            2    green
            3    yellow
            4    blue
            5    magenta
            6    cyan
            7    white

       Mutt-ng uses these attributes for handling text/enriched messages, and they can
       also be used by an external _a_u_t_o_v_i_e_w (section 5.4  , page 60) script for high-
       lighting purposes.  NNoottee:: If you change the colors for your display, for

       When the mailbox is _s_o_r_t_e_d (section 6.3.289  , page 134) by _t_h_r_e_a_d_s, there are
       a few additional functions available in the _i_n_d_e_x and _p_a_g_e_r modes.

       NNoottee:: Collapsing a thread displays only the first message in the thread and
       hides the others. This is useful when threads contain so many messages that you
       can only see a handful of threads on the screen. See %M in _$_i_n_d_e_x___f_o_r_m_a_t (sec-
       tion 6.3.110  , page 90).  For example, you could use "%?M?(#%03M)&(%4l)?" in
       _$_i_n_d_e_x___f_o_r_m_a_t (section 6.3.110  , page 90) to optionally display the number of
       hidden messages if the thread is collapsed.

       See also: _$_s_t_r_i_c_t___t_h_r_e_a_d_s (section 6.3.309  , page 141).

       Creates a new alias based upon the current message (or prompts for a new one).
       Once editing is complete, an _a_l_i_a_s (section 3.2  , page 16) command is added to
       the file specified by the _$_a_l_i_a_s___f_i_l_e (section 6.3.3  , page 65) variable for
       future use. NNoottee:: Specifying an _$_a_l_i_a_s___f_i_l_e (section 6.3.3  , page 65) does not
       add the aliases specified there-in, you must also _s_o_u_r_c_e (section 3.26  , page

       cchheecckk--ttrraaddiittiioonnaall--ppggpp
        (default: ESC P)

       This function will search the current message for content signed or encrypted
       with PGP the "traditional" way, that is, without proper MIME tagging.  Techni-
       cally, this function will temporarily change the MIME content types of the body
       parts containing PGP data; this is similar to the _e_d_i_t_-_t_y_p_e (section 2.3.4  ,
       page 8) function's effect.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                     8

       ddiissppllaayy--ttooggggllee--wweeeedd
        (default: h)

       Toggles the weeding of message header fields specified by _i_g_n_o_r_e (section
       3.8  , page 23) commands.

       eeddiitt
        (default: e)

       This command (available in the ``index'' and ``pager'') allows you to edit the
       raw current message as it's present in the mail folder.  After you have fin-
       ished editing, the changed message will be appended to the current folder, and
       the original message will be marked for deletion.

       eeddiitt--ttyyppee

       (default: ^E on the attachment menu, and in the pager and index menus; ^T on
       the compose menu)

       This command is used to temporarily edit an attachment's content type to fix,
       for instance, bogus character set parameters.  When invoked from the index or
       from the pager, you'll have the opportunity to edit the top-level attachment's
       content type.  On the _a_t_t_a_c_h_m_e_n_t _m_e_n_u (section 5.1.2  , page 53), you can
       change any attachment's content type. These changes are not persistent, and get
       lost upon changing folders.

       Note that this command is also available on the _c_o_m_p_o_s_e _m_e_n_u (section 5.1.3  ,
       page 53).  There, it's used to fine-tune the properties of attachments you are
       going to send.

       eenntteerr--ccoommmmaanndd
        (default: ``:'')

       This command is used to execute any command you would normally put in a config-
       uration file.  A common use is to check the settings of variables, or in con-
       junction with _m_a_c_r_o_s (section 3.6  , page 20) to change settings on the fly.

       eexxttrraacctt--kkeeyyss
        (default: ^K)

       This command extracts PGP public keys from the current or tagged message(s) and
       adds them to your PGP public key ring.

       ffoorrggeett--ppaasssspphhrraassee
        (default: ^F)

       This command wipes the passphrase(s) from memory. It is useful, if you mis-
       spelled the passphrase.

       lliisstt--rreeppllyy
        (default: L)

       Reply to the current or tagged message(s) by extracting any addresses which

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                     9

       match the regular expressions given by the _l_i_s_t_s _o_r _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_b_e (section 3.10  ,
       page 24) commands, but also honor any Mail-Followup-To header(s) if the
       _$_h_o_n_o_r___f_o_l_l_o_w_u_p___t_o (section 6.3.88  , page 85) configuration variable is set.
       Using this when replying to messages posted to mailing lists helps avoid dupli-
       cate copies being sent to the author of the message you are replying to.

       ppiippee--mmeessssaaggee
        (default: |)

       Asks for an external Unix command and pipes the current or tagged message(s) to
       it.  The variables _$_p_i_p_e___d_e_c_o_d_e (section 6.3.200  , page 113), _$_p_i_p_e___s_p_l_i_t
       (section 6.3.202  , page 114), _$_p_i_p_e___s_e_p (section 6.3.201  , page 114) and
       _$_w_a_i_t___k_e_y (section 6.3.332  , page 145) control the exact behavior of this
       function.

       rreesseenndd--mmeessssaaggee
        (default: ESC e)

       With resend-message, mutt takes the current message as a template for a new
       message.  This function is best described as "recall from arbitrary folders".
       It can conveniently be used to forward MIME messages while preserving the orig-
       inal mail structure. Note that the amount of headers included here depends on
       the value of the _$_w_e_e_d (section 6.3.333  , page 146) variable.

       This function is also available from the attachment menu. You can use this to
       easily resend a message which was included with a bounce message as a mes-
       sage/rfc822 body part.

       sshheellll--eessccaappee
        (default: !)

       Asks for an external Unix command and executes it.  The _$_w_a_i_t___k_e_y (section
       6.3.332  , page 145) can be used to control whether Mutt-ng will wait for a key
       to be pressed when the command returns (presumably to let the user read the
       output of the command), based on the return status of the named command.

       ttooggggllee--qquuootteedd
        (default: T)

       The _p_a_g_e_r uses the _$_q_u_o_t_e___r_e_g_e_x_p (section 6.3.225  , page 119) variable to
       detect quoted text when displaying the body of the message.  This function tog-
       gles the display of the quoted material in the message.  It is particularly
       useful when are interested in just the response and there is a large amount of
       quoted text in the way.

       sskkiipp--qquuootteedd
        (default: S)

       This function will go to the next line of non-quoted text which come after a
       line of quoted text in the internal pager.

       _2_._4  _S_e_n_d_i_n_g _M_a_i_l

            ESC k   mail-key        mail a PGP public key to someone

       Bouncing a message sends the message as is to the recipient you specify.  For-
       warding a message allows you to add comments or modify the message you are for-
       warding.  These items are discussed in greater detail in the next chapter
       _`_`_F_o_r_w_a_r_d_i_n_g _a_n_d _B_o_u_n_c_i_n_g _M_a_i_l_'_' (section 2.5  , page 13).

       Mutt-ng will then enter the _c_o_m_p_o_s_e menu and prompt you for the recipients to
       place on the ``To:'' header field.  Next, it will ask you for the ``Subject:''
       field for the message, providing a default if you are replying to or forwarding
       a message.  See also _$_a_s_k_c_c (section 6.3.10  , page 67), _$_a_s_k_b_c_c (section
       6.3.9  , page 66), _$_a_u_t_o_e_d_i_t (section 6.3.17  , page 69), _$_b_o_u_n_c_e (section
       6.3.20  , page 69), and _$_f_a_s_t___r_e_p_l_y (section 6.3.60  , page 78) for changing
       how Mutt-ng asks these questions.

       Mutt-ng will then automatically start your _$_e_d_i_t_o_r (section 6.3.55  , page 77)
       on the message body.  If the _$_e_d_i_t___h_e_a_d_e_r_s (section 6.3.54  , page 77) variable
       is set, the headers will be at the top of the message in your editor.  Any mes-
       sages you are replying to will be added in sort order to the message, with
       appropriate _$_a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_o_n (section 6.3.15  , page 68), _$_i_n_d_e_n_t___s_t_r_i_n_g (section
       6.3.109  , page 90) and _$_p_o_s_t___i_n_d_e_n_t___s_t_r_i_n_g (section 6.3.212  , page 116).
       When forwarding a message, if the _$_m_i_m_e___f_o_r_w_a_r_d (section 6.3.136  , page 97)
       variable is unset, a copy of the forwarded message will be included.  If you
       have specified a _$_s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e (section 6.3.259  , page 127), it will be appended
       to the message.

       Once you have finished editing the body of your mail message, you are returned
       to the _c_o_m_p_o_s_e menu.  The following options are available:

       NNoottee:: The attach-message function will prompt you for a folder to attach mes-
       sages from. You can now tag messages in that folder and they will be attached
       to the message you are sending. Note that certain operations like composing a
       new mail, replying, forwarding, etc. are not permitted when you are in that
       folder. The %r in _$_s_t_a_t_u_s___f_o_r_m_a_t (section 6.3.305  , page 138) will change to a
       'A' to indicate that you are in attach-message mode.

       When editing the header of your outgoing message, there are a couple of special
       features available.

       If you specify

       Fcc: _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e

       Mutt-ng will pick up _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e just as if you had used the _e_d_i_t_-_f_c_c function in
       the _c_o_m_p_o_s_e menu.

       You can also attach files to your message by specifying

       Attach: _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  [ _d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n ]

       where _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is the file to attach and _d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n is an optional string to
       use as the description of the attached file.

       When replying to messages, if you remove the _I_n_-_R_e_p_l_y_-_T_o_: field from the header
       field, Mutt-ng will not generate a _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s_: field, which allows you to cre-
       ate a new message thread.

       Also see _e_d_i_t___h_e_a_d_e_r_s (section 6.3.54  , page 77).

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    12

       If you want to use PGP, you can specify

       Pgp: [ E | S | S_<_i_d_> ]

       ``E'' encrypts, ``S'' signs and ``S<id>'' signs with the given key, setting
       _$_p_g_p___s_i_g_n___a_s (section 6.3.192  , page 112) permanently.

       If you have told mutt to PGP encrypt a message, it will guide you through a key
       selection process when you try to send the message.  Mutt-ng will not ask you
       any questions about keys which have a certified user ID matching one of the
       message recipients' mail addresses.  However, there may be situations in which
       there are several keys, weakly certified user ID fields, or where no matching
       keys can be found.

       In these cases, you are dropped into a menu with a list of keys from which you
       can select one.  When you quit this menu, or mutt can't find any matching keys,
       you are prompted for a user ID.  You can, as usually, abort this prompt using
       ^G.  When you do so, mutt will return to the compose screen.

       Once you have successfully finished the key selection, the message will be
       encrypted using the selected public keys, and sent out.

       Most fields of the entries in the key selection menu (see also _$_p_g_p___e_n_t_r_y___f_o_r_-
       _m_a_t (section 6.3.179  , page 109)) have obvious meanings.  But some explana-
       tions on the capabilities, flags, and validity fields are in order.

       The flags sequence (%f) will expand to one of the following flags:

            R            The key has been revoked and can't be used.
            X            The key is expired and can't be used.
            d            You have marked the key as disabled.
            c            There are unknown critical self-signature
                         packets.

       The capabilities field (%c) expands to a two-character sequence representing a
       key's capabilities.  The first character gives the key's encryption capabili-
       ties: A minus sign (--) means that the key cannot be used for encryption.  A dot
       (..) means that it's marked as a signature key in one of the user IDs, but may
       also be used for encryption.  The letter ee indicates that this key can be used
       for encryption.

       The second character indicates the key's signing capabilities.  Once again, a
       ``--'' implies ``not for signing'', ``..'' implies that the key is marked as an
       encryption key in one of the user-ids, and ``ss'' denotes a key which can be
       used for signing.

       Finally, the validity field (%t) indicates how well-certified a user-id is.  A
       question mark (??) indicates undefined validity, a minus character (--) marks an
       untrusted association, a space character means a partially trusted association,
       and a plus character (++) indicates complete validity.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    13

       You may also have configured mutt to co-operate with Mixmaster, an anonymous
       remailer.  Mixmaster permits you to send your messages anonymously using a
       chain of remailers. Mixmaster support in mutt is for mixmaster version 2.04
       (beta 45 appears to be the latest) and 2.03.  It does not support earlier ver-
       sions or the later so-called version 3 betas, of which the latest appears to be
       called 2.9b23.

       To use it, you'll have to obey certain restrictions.  Most important, you can-
       not use the Cc and Bcc headers.  To tell Mutt-ng to use mixmaster, you have to
       select a remailer chain, using the mix function on the compose menu.

       The chain selection screen is divided into two parts.  In the (larger) upper
       part, you get a list of remailers you may use.  In the lower part, you see the
       currently selected chain of remailers.

       You can navigate in the chain using the chain-prev and chain-next functions,
       which are by default bound to the left and right arrows and to the h and l keys
       (think vi keyboard bindings).  To insert a remailer at the current chain posi-
       tion, use the insert function.  To append a remailer behind the current chain
       position, use select-entry or append.  You can also delete entries from the
       chain, using the corresponding function.  Finally, to abandon your changes,
       leave the menu, or accept them pressing (by default) the Return key.

       Note that different remailers do have different capabilities, indicated in the
       %c entry of the remailer menu lines (see _$_m_i_x___e_n_t_r_y___f_o_r_m_a_t (section 6.3.139  ,
       page 98)).  Most important is the ``middleman'' capability, indicated by a cap-
       ital ``M'': This means that the remailer in question cannot be used as the
       final element of a chain, but will only forward messages to other mixmaster
       remailers.  For details on the other capabilities, please have a look at the
       mixmaster documentation.

       Bouncing and forwarding let you send an existing message to recipients that you
       specify.  Bouncing a message uses the _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l (section 6.3.247  , page 124)
       command to send a copy to alternative addresses as if they were the message's
       original recipients.  Forwarding a message, on the other hand, allows you to
       modify the message before it is resent (for example, by adding your own com-
       ments).

       The following keys are bound by default:

            f       forward         forward message
            b       bounce          bounce (remail) message

       Forwarding can be done by including the original message in the new message's
       body (surrounded by indicating lines) or including it as a MIME attachment,
       depending on the value of the _$_m_i_m_e___f_o_r_w_a_r_d (section 6.3.136  , page 97) vari-
       able.  Decoding of attachments, like in the pager, can be controlled by the
       _$_f_o_r_w_a_r_d___d_e_c_o_d_e (section 6.3.69  , page 81) and _$_m_i_m_e___f_o_r_w_a_r_d___d_e_c_o_d_e (section

       6.3.137  , page 98) variables, respectively.  The desired forwarding format may
       depend on the content, therefore _$_m_i_m_e___f_o_r_w_a_r_d is a quadoption which, for exam-
       ple, can be set to ``ask-no''.

       The inclusion of headers is controlled by the current setting of the _$_w_e_e_d
       (section 6.3.333  , page 146) variable, unless _m_i_m_e___f_o_r_w_a_r_d (section 6.3.136  ,
       page 97) is set.

       Editing the message to forward follows the same procedure as sending or reply-
       ing to a message does.

       At times it is desirable to delay sending a message that you have already begun
       to compose.  When the _p_o_s_t_p_o_n_e_-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e function is used in the _c_o_m_p_o_s_e menu,
       the body of your message and attachments are stored in the mailbox specified by
       the _$_p_o_s_t_p_o_n_e_d (section 6.3.214  , page 117) variable.  This means that you can
       recall the message even if you exit Mutt-ng and then restart it at a later
       time.

       Once a message is postponed, there are several ways to resume it.  From the
       command line you can use the ``-p'' option, or if you _c_o_m_p_o_s_e a new message
       from the _i_n_d_e_x or _p_a_g_e_r you will be prompted if postponed messages exist.  If
       multiple messages are currently postponed, the _p_o_s_t_p_o_n_e_d menu will pop up and
       you can select which message you would like to resume.

       NNoottee:: If you postpone a reply to a message, the reply setting of the message is
       only updated when you actually finish the message and send it.  Also, you must
       be in the same folder with the message you replied to for the status of the
       message to be updated.

       See also the _$_p_o_s_t_p_o_n_e (section 6.3.213  , page 116) quad-option.

       If compiled with ``--enable-nntp'' option, Mutt-ng can read news from
       newsserver via NNTP.  You can open a newsgroup with function ``change-news-
       group'' (default: i).  Default newsserver can be obtained from _N_N_T_P_S_E_R_V_E_R envi-
       ronment variable.  Like other news readers, info about subscribed newsgroups is
       saved in file by _$_n_n_t_p___n_e_w_s_r_c (section 6.3.156  , page 103) variable. Article
       headers are cached and can be loaded from file when newsgroup entered instead
       loading from newsserver.

       While the default configuration (or ``preferences'') make Mutt-ng usable right
       out of the box, it is often desirable to tailor Mutt-ng to suit your own
       tastes. When Mutt-ng is first invoked, it will attempt to read the ``system''
       configuration file (defaults set by your local system administrator), unless
       the ``-n'' _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _l_i_n_e (section 6.1  , page 62) option is specified.  This
       file is typically /usr/local/share/muttng/Muttngrc or /etc/Muttngrc, Mutt-ng
       users will find this file in /usr/local/share/muttng/Muttrc or /etc/Muttngrc.
       Mutt will next look for a file named .muttrc in your home directory, Mutt-ng

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    15

       will look for .muttngrc.  If this file does not exist and your home directory
       has a subdirectory named .mutt, mutt try to load a file named .muttng/muttngrc.

       .muttrc (or .muttngrc for Mutt-ng) is the file where you will usually place
       your _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s (section 6.2  , page 62) to configure Mutt-ng.

       In addition, mutt supports version specific configuration files that are parsed
       instead of the default files as explained above.  For instance, if your system
       has a Muttrc-0.88 file in the system configuration directory, and you are run-
       ning version 0.88 of mutt, this file will be sourced instead of the Muttngrc
       file.  The same is true of the user configuration file, if you have a file
       .muttrc-0.88.6 in your home directory, when you run mutt version 0.88.6, it
       will source this file instead of the default .muttrc file.  The version number
       is the same which is visible using the ``-v'' _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _l_i_n_e (section 6.1  , page
       62) switch or using the show-version key (default: V) from the index menu.

       An initialization file consists of a series of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s (section 6.2  , page
       62).  Each line of the file may contain one or more commands.  When multiple
       commands are used, they must be separated by a semicolon (;).

            set realname='Mutt-ng user' ; ignore x-

       The hash mark, or pound sign (``#''), is used as a ``comment'' character. You
       can use it to annotate your initialization file. All text after the comment
       character to the end of the line is ignored. For example,

            my_hdr X-Disclaimer: Why are you listening to me? # This is a comment

       Single quotes (') and double quotes (') can be used to quote strings which con-
       tain spaces or other special characters.  The difference between the two types
       of quotes is similar to that of many popular shell programs, namely that a sin-
       gle quote is used to specify a literal string (one that is not interpreted for
       shell variables or quoting with a backslash [see next paragraph]), while double
       quotes indicate a string for which should be evaluated.  For example, backtics
       are evaluated inside of double quotes, but nnoott for single quotes.

       \ quotes the next character, just as in shells such as bash and zsh.  For exam-
       ple, if want to put quotes ``''' inside of a string, you can use ``\'' to force
       the next character to be a literal instead of interpreted character.

            set realname="Michael \"MuttDude\" Elkins"

       ``\\'' means to insert a literal ``\'' into the line.  ``\n'' and ``\r'' have
       their usual C meanings of linefeed and carriage-return, respectively.

       A \ at the end of a line can be used to split commands over multiple lines,
       provided that the split points don't appear in the middle of command names.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    16

       Please note that, unlike the various shells, mutt-ng interprets a ``\'' at the
       end of a line also in comments. This allows you to disable a command split over
       multiple lines with only one ``#''.

            # folder-hook . \
              set realname="Michael \"MuttDude\" Elkins"

       When testing your config files, beware the following caveat. The backslash at
       the end of the commented line extends the current line with the next line -
       then referred to as a ``continuation line''.  As the first line is commented
       with a hash (#) all following continuation lines are also part of a comment and
       therefore are ignored, too. So take care of comments when continuation lines
       are involved within your setup files!

       Abstract example:

            line1\
            line2a # line2b\
            line3\
            line4
            line5

       line1 ``continues'' until line4. however, the part after the # is a comment
       which includes line3 and line4. line5 is a new line of its own and thus is
       interpreted again.

       It is also possible to substitute the output of a Unix command in an initial-
       ization file.  This is accomplished by enclosing the command in backquotes
       (``).  For example,

            my_hdr X-Operating-System: `uname -a`

       The output of the Unix command ``uname -a'' will be substituted before the line
       is parsed.  Note that since initialization files are line oriented, only the
       first line of output from the Unix command will be substituted.

       UNIX environments can be accessed like the way it is done in shells like sh and
       bash: Prepend the name of the environment by a ``$''.  For example,

            set record=+sent_on_$HOSTNAME

       The commands understood by mutt are explained in the next paragraphs.  For a
       complete list, see the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e (section 6.2  , page 62).

       _3_._2  _D_e_f_i_n_i_n_g_/_U_s_i_n_g _a_l_i_a_s_e_s

       Usage: alias _k_e_y _a_d_d_r_e_s_s [ , _a_d_d_r_e_s_s, ... ]

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    17

       It's usually very cumbersome to remember or type out the address of someone you
       are communicating with.  Mutt-ng allows you to create ``aliases'' which map a
       short string to a full address.

       NNoottee:: if you want to create an alias for a group (by specifying more than one
       address), you mmuusstt separate the addresses with a comma (``,'').

       To remove an alias or aliases (``*'' means all aliases):

       unalias [ * | _k_e_y _._._. ]

            alias muttdude me@cs.hmc.edu (Michael Elkins)
            alias theguys manny, moe, jack

       Unlike other mailers, Mutt-ng doesn't require aliases to be defined in a spe-
       cial file.  The alias command can appear anywhere in a configuration file, as
       long as this file is _s_o_u_r_c_e_d (section 3.26  , page 32).  Consequently, you can
       have multiple alias files, or you can have all aliases defined in your muttrc.

       On the other hand, the _c_r_e_a_t_e_-_a_l_i_a_s (section 2.3.4  , page 7) function can use
       only one file, the one pointed to by the _$_a_l_i_a_s___f_i_l_e (section 6.3.3  , page 65)
       variable (which is ~/.muttrc by default). This file is not special either, in
       the sense that Mutt-ng will happily append aliases to any file, but in order
       for the new aliases to take effect you need to explicitly _s_o_u_r_c_e (section
       3.26  , page 32) this file too.

       For example:

            source /usr/local/share/Mutt-ng.aliases
            source ~/.mail_aliases
            set alias_file=~/.mail_aliases

       To use aliases, you merely use the alias at any place in mutt where mutt
       prompts for addresses, such as the _T_o_: or _C_c_: prompt.  You can also enter
       aliases in your editor at the appropriate headers if you have the _$_e_d_i_t___h_e_a_d_e_r_s
       (section 6.3.54  , page 77) variable set.

       In addition, at the various address prompts, you can use the tab character to
       expand a partial alias to the full alias.  If there are multiple matches, mutt
       will bring up a menu with the matching aliases.  In order to be presented with
       the full list of aliases, you must hit tab with out a partial alias, such as at
       the beginning of the prompt or after a comma denoting multiple addresses.

       In the alias menu, you can select as many aliases as you want with the _s_e_l_e_c_t_-
       _e_n_t_r_y key (default: RET), and use the _e_x_i_t key (default: q) to return to the
       address prompt.

       Usage: bind _m_a_p _k_e_y _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    18

       This command allows you to change the default key bindings (operation invoked
       when pressing a key).

       _m_a_p specifies in which menu the binding belongs.  Multiple maps may be speci-
       fied by separating them with commas (no additional whitespace is allowed). The
       currently defined maps are:

             generic
                   This is not a real menu, but is used as a fallback for all of the
                   other menus except for the pager and editor modes.  If a key is not
                   defined in another menu, Mutt-ng will look for a binding to use in
                   this menu.  This allows you to bind a key to a certain function in
                   multiple menus instead of having multiple bind statements to accom-
                   plish the same task.

             alias
                   The alias menu is the list of your personal aliases as defined in
                   your muttrc.  It is the mapping from a short alias name to the full
                   email address(es) of the recipient(s).

             attach
                   The attachment menu is used to access the attachments on received
                   messages.

             browser
                   The browser is used for both browsing the local directory struc-
                   ture, and for listing all of your incoming mailboxes.

             editor
                   The editor is the line-based editor the user enters text data.

             index
                   The index is the list of messages contained in a mailbox.

             compose
                   The compose menu is the screen used when sending a new message.

             pager
                   The pager is the mode used to display message/attachment data, and
                   help listings.

             pgp
                   The pgp menu is used to select the OpenPGP keys used for encrypting
                   outgoing messages.

             postpone
                   The postpone menu is similar to the index menu, except is used when
                   recalling a message the user was composing, but saved until later.

       _k_e_y is the key (or key sequence) you wish to bind.  To specify a control char-
       acter, use the sequence _\_C_x, where _x is the letter of the control character
       (for example, to specify control-A use ``\Ca'').  Note that the case of _x as

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    19

       well as _\_C is ignored, so that _\_C_A, _\_C_a, _\_c_A and _\_c_a are all equivalent.  An
       alternative form is to specify the key as a three digit octal number prefixed
       with a ``\'' (for example _\_1_7_7 is equivalent to _\_c_?).

       In addition, _k_e_y may consist of:

            \t              tab
            <tab>           tab
            \r              carriage return

       _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n specifies which action to take when _k_e_y is pressed.  For a complete
       list of functions, see the _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e (section 6.4  , page 147).  The special

       The charset-hook command defines an alias for a character set.  This is useful
       to properly display messages which are tagged with a character set name not
       known to mutt.

       The iconv-hook command defines a system-specific name for a character set.
       This is helpful when your systems character conversion library insists on using
       strange, system-specific names for character sets.

       Usage: folder-hook [!]_r_e_g_e_x_p _c_o_m_m_a_n_d

       It is often desirable to change settings based on which mailbox you are read-
       ing.  The folder-hook command provides a method by which you can execute any
       configuration command.  _r_e_g_e_x_p is a regular expression specifying in which
       mailboxes to execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d before loading.  If a mailbox matches multiple
       folder-hook's, they are executed in the order given in the muttrc.

       NNoottee:: if you use the ``!'' shortcut for _$_s_p_o_o_l_f_i_l_e (section 6.3.295  , page
       136) at the beginning of the pattern, you must place it inside of double or
       single quotes in order to distinguish it from the logical _n_o_t operator for the
       expression.

       Note that the settings are _n_o_t restored when you leave the mailbox.  For exam-
       ple, a command action to perform is to change the sorting method based upon the
       mailbox being read:

            folder-hook mutt set sort=threads

       However, the sorting method is not restored to its previous value when reading
       a different mailbox.  To specify a _d_e_f_a_u_l_t command, use the pattern ``.'':

            folder-hook . set sort=date-sent

       _3_._6  _K_e_y_b_o_a_r_d _m_a_c_r_o_s

       Usage: macro _m_e_n_u _k_e_y _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e [ _d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n ]

       Macros are useful when you would like a single key to perform a series of
       actions.  When you press _k_e_y in menu _m_e_n_u, Mutt-ng will behave as if you had
       typed _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e.  So if you have a common sequence of commands you type, you can
       create a macro to execute those commands with a single key.

       _m_e_n_u is the _m_a_p (section 3.3  , page 17) which the macro will be bound.  Multi-
       ple maps may be specified by separating multiple menu arguments by commas.
       Whitespace may not be used in between the menu arguments and the commas sepa-
       rating them.

       _k_e_y and _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e are expanded by the same rules as the _k_e_y _b_i_n_d_i_n_g_s (section
       3.3  , page 17).  There are some additions however.  The first is that control
       characters in _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e can also be specified as _^_x.  In order to get a caret
       (`^'') you need to use _^_^.  Secondly, to specify a certain key such as _u_p or to
       invoke a function directly, you can use the format _<_k_e_y _n_a_m_e_> and _<_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n
       _n_a_m_e_>.  For a listing of key names see the section on _k_e_y _b_i_n_d_i_n_g_s (section
       3.3  , page 17).  Functions are listed in the _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e (section
       6.4  , page 147).

       The advantage with using function names directly is that the macros will work
       regardless of the current key bindings, so they are not dependent on the user
       having particular key definitions.  This makes them more robust and portable,
       and also facilitates defining of macros in files used by more than one user
       (eg. the system Muttngrc).

       Optionally you can specify a descriptive text after _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e, which is shown in
       the help screens.

       NNoottee:: Macro definitions (if any) listed in the help screen(s), are silently
       truncated at the screen width, and are not wrapped.

       If your terminal supports color, you can spice up Mutt-ng by creating your own
       color scheme.  To define the color of an object (type of information), you must
       specify both a foreground color aanndd a background color (it is not possible to
       only specify one or the other).

       _o_b_j_e_c_t can be one of:

          +o attachment

          +o body (match _r_e_g_e_x_p in the body of messages)

          +o bold (highlighting bold patterns in the body of messages)

          +o tilde (the ``~'' used to pad blank lines in the pager)

          +o tree (thread tree drawn in the message index and attachment menu)

       _f_o_r_e_g_r_o_u_n_d and _b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d can be one of the following:

          +o white

          +o black

          +o green

          +o magenta

          +o blue

          +o cyan

          +o yellow

          +o red

          +o default

          +o color_x

       _f_o_r_e_g_r_o_u_n_d can optionally be prefixed with the keyword bright to make the fore-
       ground color boldfaced (e.g., brightred).

       If your terminal supports it, the special keyword _d_e_f_a_u_l_t can be used as a
       transparent color.  The value _b_r_i_g_h_t_d_e_f_a_u_l_t is also valid.  If Mutt-ng is
       linked against the _S_-_L_a_n_g library, you also need to set the _C_O_L_O_R_F_G_B_G environ-
       ment variable to the default colors of your terminal for this to work; for
       example (for Bourne-like shells):

            set COLORFGBG="green;black"
            export COLORFGBG

       NNoottee:: The _S_-_L_a_n_g library requires you to use the _l_i_g_h_t_g_r_a_y and _b_r_o_w_n keywords
       instead of _w_h_i_t_e and _y_e_l_l_o_w when setting this variable.

       NNoottee:: The uncolor command can be applied to the index object only.  It removes
       entries from the list. You mmuusstt specify the same pattern specified in the color
       command for it to be removed.  The pattern ``*'' is a special token which means
       to clear the color index list of all entries.

       Mutt-ng also recognizes the keywords _c_o_l_o_r_0, _c_o_l_o_r_1, ..., _c_o_l_o_rNN--11 (NN being the
       number of colors supported by your terminal).  This is useful when you remap
       the colors for your display (for example by changing the color associated with
       _c_o_l_o_r_2 for your xterm), since color names may then lose their normal meaning.

       If your terminal does not support color, it is still possible change the video
       attributes through the use of the ``mono'' command:

       Usage: mono _<_o_b_j_e_c_t_> _<_a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e_> [ _r_e_g_e_x_p ]

       Usage: unmono index _p_a_t_t_e_r_n [ _p_a_t_t_e_r_n ...  ]

       where _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e is one of the following:

          +o none

          +o bold

          +o underline

          +o reverse

          +o standout

       Usage: [un]ignore _p_a_t_t_e_r_n [ _p_a_t_t_e_r_n ... ]

       Messages often have many header fields added by automatic processing systems,
       or which may not seem useful to display on the screen.  This command allows you
       to specify header fields which you don't normally want to see.

       You do not need to specify the full header field name.  For example, ``ignore
       content-'' will ignore all header fields that begin with the pattern ``con-
       tent-''. ``ignore *'' will ignore all headers.

       To remove a previously added token from the list, use the ``unignore'' command.
       The ``unignore'' command will make Mutt-ng display headers with the given pat-
       tern.  For example, if you do ``ignore x-'' it is possible to ``unignore x-
       mailer''.

       ``unignore *'' will remove all tokens from the ignore list.

       For example:

            # Sven's draconian header weeding
            ignore *
            unignore from date subject to cc
            unignore organization organisation x-mailer: x-newsreader: x-mailing-list:
            unignore posted-to:

       Usage: [un]alternates _r_e_g_e_x_p [ _r_e_g_e_x_p ... ]

       With various functions, mutt will treat messages differently, depending on

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    24

       whether you sent them or whether you received them from someone else.  For
       instance, when replying to a message that you sent to a different party, mutt
       will automatically suggest to send the response to the original message's
       recipients -- responding to yourself won't make much sense in many cases.  (See
       _$_r_e_p_l_y___t_o (section 6.3.233  , page 121).)

       Many users receive e-mail under a number of different addresses. To fully use
       mutt's features here, the program must be able to recognize what e-mail
       addresses you receive mail under. That's the purpose of the alternates command:
       It takes a list of regular expressions, each of which can identify an address
       under which you receive e-mail.

       The unalternates command can be used to write exceptions to alternates pat-
       terns. If an address matches something in an alternates command, but you none-
       theless do not think it is from you, you can list a more precise pattern under
       an unalternates command.

       To remove a regular expression from the alternates list, use the unalternates
       command with exactly the same _r_e_g_e_x_p.  Likewise, if the _r_e_g_e_x_p for a alternates
       command matches an entry on the unalternates list, that unalternates entry will
       be removed. If the _r_e_g_e_x_p for unalternates is ``*'', _a_l_l _e_n_t_r_i_e_s on alternates
       will be removed.

       Usage: [un]subscribe _r_e_g_e_x_p [ _r_e_g_e_x_p ... ]

       Mutt-ng has a few nice features for _h_a_n_d_l_i_n_g _m_a_i_l_i_n_g _l_i_s_t_s (section 4.9  , page
       44).  In order to take advantage of them, you must specify which addresses
       belong to mailing lists, and which mailing lists you are subscribed to.  Once
       you have done this, the _l_i_s_t_-_r_e_p_l_y (section 2.3.4  , page 8) function will work
       for all known lists.  Additionally, when you send a message to a subscribed
       list, mutt will add a Mail-Followup-To header to tell other users' mail user
       agents not to send copies of replies to your personal address.   Note that the
       Mail-Followup-To header is a non-standard extension which is not supported by
       all mail user agents.  Adding it is not bullet-proof against receiving personal
       CCs of list messages.  Also note that the generation of the Mail-Followup-To
       header is controlled by the _$_f_o_l_l_o_w_u_p___t_o (section 6.3.66  , page 80) configura-
       tion variable.

       More precisely, Mutt-ng maintains lists of patterns for the addresses of known
       and subscribed mailing lists.  Every subscribed mailing list is known. To mark
       a mailing list as known, use the ``lists'' command.  To mark it as subscribed,
       use ``subscribe''.

       You can use regular expressions with both commands.  To mark all messages sent
       to a specific bug report's address on mutt's bug tracking system as list mail,
       for instance, you could say ``subscribe [0-9]*@bugs.guug.de''.  Often, it's
       sufficient to just give a portion of the list's e-mail address.

       Specify as much of the address as you need to to remove ambiguity.  For exam-
       ple, if you've subscribed to the Mutt-ng mailing list, you will receive mail

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    25

       list, you could add ``lists mutt-users'' to your initialization file.  To tell
       mutt that you are subscribed to it, add ``subscribe mutt-users'' to your ini-
       tialization file instead.  If you also happen to get mail from someone whose
       address is _m_u_t_t_-_u_s_e_r_s_@_e_x_a_m_p_l_e_._c_o_m, you could use ``lists mutt-
       users@mutt\\.org'' or ``subscribe mutt-users@mutt\\.org'' to match only mail
       from the actual list.

       The ``unlists'' command is used to remove a token from the list of known and
       subscribed mailing-lists. Use ``unlists *'' to remove all tokens.

       To remove a mailing list from the list of subscribed mailing lists, but keep it
       on the list of known mailing lists, use ``unsubscribe''.

       This command is used to move read messages from a specified mailbox to a dif-
       ferent mailbox automatically when you quit or change folders.  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is a
       regular expression specifying the mailbox to treat as a ``spool'' mailbox and
       _m_a_i_l_b_o_x specifies where mail should be saved when read.

       Unlike some of the other _h_o_o_k commands, only the _f_i_r_s_t matching pattern is used
       (it is not possible to save read mail in more than a single mailbox).

       Usage: [un]mailboxes [!]_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e [ _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e ... ]

       This command specifies folders which can receive mail and which will be checked
       for new messages.  By default, the main menu status bar displays how many of
       these folders have new messages.

       When changing folders, pressing _s_p_a_c_e will cycle through folders with new mail.

       Pressing TAB in the directory browser will bring up a menu showing the files
       specified by the mailboxes command, and indicate which contain new messages.
       Mutt-ng will automatically enter this mode when invoked from the command line
       with the -y option.

       The ``unmailboxes'' command is used to remove a token from the list of folders
       which receive mail. Use ``unmailboxes *'' to remove all tokens.

       NNoottee:: new mail is detected by comparing the last modification time to the last
       access time.  Utilities like biff or frm or any other program which accesses
       the mailbox might cause Mutt-ng to never detect new mail for that mailbox if
       they do not properly reset the access time.  Backup tools are another common
       reason for updated access times.

       NNoottee:: the filenames in the mailboxes command are resolved when the command is
       executed, so if these names contain _s_h_o_r_t_c_u_t _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s (section 4.8  , page
       44) (such as ``='' and ``!''), any variable definition that affect these char-
       acters (like _$_f_o_l_d_e_r (section 6.3.64  , page 79) and _$_s_p_o_o_l_f_i_l_e (section

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    26

       6.3.295  , page 136)) should be executed before the mailboxes command.

       _3_._1_3  _U_s_e_r _d_e_f_i_n_e_d _h_e_a_d_e_r_s

       Usage:

       my_hdr _s_t_r_i_n_g

       unmy_hdr _f_i_e_l_d [ _f_i_e_l_d ... ]

       The ``my_hdr'' command allows you to create your own header fields which will
       be added to every message you send.

       For example, if you would like to add an ``Organization:'' header field to all
       of your outgoing messages, you can put the command

            my_hdr Organization: A Really Big Company, Anytown, USA

       in your .muttrc.

       NNoottee::  space characters are _n_o_t allowed between the keyword and the colon
       (``:'').  The standard for electronic mail (RFC822) says that space is illegal
       there, so Mutt-ng enforces the rule.

       If you would like to add a header field to a single message, you should either
       set the _e_d_i_t___h_e_a_d_e_r_s (section 6.3.54  , page 77) variable, or use the _e_d_i_t_-
       _h_e_a_d_e_r_s function (default: ``E'') in the send-menu so that you can edit the
       header of your message along with the body.

       To remove user defined header fields, use the ``unmy_hdr'' command.  You may
       specify an asterisk (``*'') to remove all header fields, or the fields to
       remove.  For example, to remove all ``To'' and ``Cc'' header fields, you could
       use:

            unmy_hdr to cc

       Usage: hdr_order _h_e_a_d_e_r_1 _h_e_a_d_e_r_2 _h_e_a_d_e_r_3

       With this command, you can specify an order in which mutt will attempt to
       present headers to you when viewing messages.

       ``unhdr_order *'' will clear all previous headers from the order list, thus
       removing the header order effects set by the system-wide startup file.

       This command is used to override the default filename used when saving mes-
       sages.  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e will be used as the default filename if the message is _F_r_o_m_:
       an address matching _r_e_g_e_x_p or if you are the author and the message is
       addressed _t_o_: something matching _r_e_g_e_x_p.

       This command is used to save outgoing mail in a mailbox other than _$_r_e_c_o_r_d
       (section 6.3.230  , page 120).  Mutt-ng searches the initial list of message
       recipients for the first matching _r_e_g_e_x_p and uses _m_a_i_l_b_o_x as the default Fcc:
       mailbox.  If no match is found the message will be saved to _$_r_e_c_o_r_d (section
       6.3.230  , page 120) mailbox.

       Example: fcc-hook [@.]aol\\.com$ +spammers

       The above will save a copy of all messages going to the aol.com domain to the

       These commands can be used to execute arbitrary configuration commands based
       upon recipients of the message.  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is a regular expression matching the
       desired address.  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is executed when _r_e_g_e_x_p matches recipients of the
       message.

       reply-hook is matched against the message you are _r_e_p_l_y_i_n_g ttoo, instead of the
       message you are _s_e_n_d_i_n_g.  send-hook is matched against all messages, both _n_e_w
       and _r_e_p_l_i_e_s.  NNoottee:: reply-hooks are matched bbeeffoorree the send-hook, rreeggaarrddlleessss of
       the order specified in the users's configuration file.

       send2-hook is matched every time a message is changed, either by editing it, or
       by using the compose menu to change its recipients or subject.  send2-hook is
       executed after send-hook, and can, e.g., be used to set parameters such as the
       _$_s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l (section 6.3.247  , page 124) variable depending on the message's
       sender address.

       For each type of send-hook or reply-hook, when multiple matches occur, commands
       are executed in the order they are specified in the muttrc (for that type of
       hook).

       See _M_e_s_s_a_g_e _M_a_t_c_h_i_n_g _i_n _H_o_o_k_s (section 4.4.1  , page 41) for information on the
       exact format of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

       Example: send-hook mutt 'set mime_forward signature='''

       Another typical use for this command is to change the values of the _$_a_t_t_r_i_b_u_-
       _t_i_o_n (section 6.3.15  , page 68), _$_s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e (section 6.3.259  , page 127) and
       _$_l_o_c_a_l_e (section 6.3.114  , page 93) variables in order to change the language
       of the attributions and signatures based upon the recipients.

       NNoottee:: the send-hook's are only executed ONCE after getting the initial list of
       recipients.  Adding a recipient after replying or editing the message will NOT
       cause any send-hook to be executed.  Also note that my_hdr commands which mod-
       ify recipient headers, or the message's subject, don't have any effect on the
       current message when executed from a send-hook.

       This command can be used to execute arbitrary configuration commands before
       viewing or formatting a message based upon information about the message.  _c_o_m_-
       _m_a_n_d is executed if the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n matches the message to be displayed. When mul-
       tiple matches occur, commands are executed in the order they are specified in
       the muttrc.

       When encrypting messages with PGP or OpenSSL, you may want to associate a cer-
       tain key with a given e-mail address automatically, either because the recipi-
       ent's public key can't be deduced from the destination address, or because, for
       some reasons, you need to override the key Mutt-ng would normally use.  The
       crypt-hook command provides a method by which you can specify the ID of the
       public key to be used when encrypting messages to a certain recipient.

       The meaning of "key id" is to be taken broadly in this context:  You can either
       put a numerical key ID here, an e-mail address, or even just a real name.

       This command adds the named string to the keyboard buffer. The string may con-
       tain control characters, key names and function names like the sequence string
       in the _m_a_c_r_o (section 3.6  , page 20) command. You may use it to automatically
       run a sequence of commands at startup, or when entering certain folders.

       Usage: unscore _p_a_t_t_e_r_n [ _p_a_t_t_e_r_n ... ]

       The score commands adds _v_a_l_u_e to a message's score if _p_a_t_t_e_r_n matches it.  _p_a_t_-
       _t_e_r_n is a string in the format described in the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s (section 4.2  , page
       36) section (note: For efficiency reasons, patterns which scan information not
       available in the index, such as ~b, ~B or ~h, may not be used).  _v_a_l_u_e is a
       positive or negative integer.  A message's final score is the sum total of all
       matching score entries.  However, you may optionally prefix _v_a_l_u_e with an equal
       sign (=) to cause evaluation to stop at a particular entry if there is a match.
       Negative final scores are rounded up to 0.

       The unscore command removes score entries from the list.  You mmuusstt specify the
       same pattern specified in the score command for it to be removed.  The pattern
       ``*'' is a special token which means to clear the list of all score entries.

       Usage: spam _p_a_t_t_e_r_n _f_o_r_m_a_t

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    30

       Usage: nospam _p_a_t_t_e_r_n

       Mutt-ng has generalized support for external spam-scoring filters.  By defining
       your spam patterns with the spam and nospam commands, you can _l_i_m_i_t, _s_e_a_r_c_h,
       and _s_o_r_t your mail based on its spam attributes, as determined by the external
       filter. You also can display the spam attributes in your index display using
       the %H selector in the _$_i_n_d_e_x___f_o_r_m_a_t (section 6.3.110  , page 90) variable.
       (Tip: try %?H?[%H] ?  to display spam tags only when they are defined for a
       given message.)

       Your first step is to define your external filter's spam patterns using the
       spam command. _p_a_t_t_e_r_n should be a regular expression that matches a header in a
       mail message. If any message in the mailbox matches this regular expression, it
       will receive a ``spam tag'' or ``spam attribute'' (unless it also matches a
       nospam pattern -- see below.) The appearance of this attribute is entirely up
       to you, and is governed by the _f_o_r_m_a_t parameter. _f_o_r_m_a_t can be any static text,
       but it also can include back-references from the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n expression. (A regular
       expression ``back-reference'' refers to a sub-expression contained within
       parentheses.) %1 is replaced with the first back-reference in the regex, %2
       with the second, etc.

       If you're using multiple spam filters, a message can have more than one spam-
       related header. You can define spam patterns for each filter you use. If a mes-
       sage matches two or more of these patterns, and the $spam_separator variable is
       set to a string, then the message's spam tag will consist of all the _f_o_r_m_a_t
       strings joined together, with the value of $spam_separator separating them.

       For example, suppose I use DCC, SpamAssassin, and PureMessage. I might define
       these spam settings:

            spam "X-DCC-.*-Metrics:.*(....)=many"         "90+/DCC-%1"
            spam "X-Spam-Status: Yes"                     "90+/SA"
            spam "X-PerlMX-Spam: .*Probability=([0-9]+)%" "%1/PM"
            set spam_separator=", "

       If I then received a message that DCC registered with ``many'' hits under the
       ``Fuz2'' checksum, and that PureMessage registered with a 97% probability of
       being spam, that message's spam tag would read 90+/DCC-Fuz2, 97/PM. (The four
       characters before ``=many'' in a DCC report indicate the checksum used -- in
       this case, ``Fuz2''.)

       If the $spam_separator variable is unset, then each spam pattern match super-
       sedes the previous one. Instead of getting joined _f_o_r_m_a_t strings, you'll get
       only the last one to match.

       The spam tag is what will be displayed in the index when you use %H in the
       $index_format variable. It's also the string that the ~H pattern-matching
       expression matches against for _s_e_a_r_c_h and _l_i_m_i_t functions. And it's what sort-
       ing by spam attribute will use as a sort key.

       That's a pretty complicated example, and most people's actual environments will
       have only one spam filter. The simpler your configuration, the more effective
       mutt can be, especially when it comes to sorting.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    31

       Generally, when you sort by spam tag, mutt will sort _l_e_x_i_c_a_l_l_y -- that is, by
       ordering strings alphnumerically. However, if a spam tag begins with a number,
       mutt will sort numerically first, and lexically only when two numbers are equal
       in value. (This is like UNIX's sort -n.) A message with no spam attributes at
       all -- that is, one that didn't match _a_n_y of your spam patterns -- is sorted at
       lowest priority. Numbers are sorted next, beginning with 0 and ranging upward.
       Finally, non-numeric strings are sorted, with ``a'' taking lower priority than
       ``z''. Clearly, in general, sorting by spam tags is most effective when you can
       coerce your filter to give you a raw number. But in case you can't, mutt can
       still do something useful.

       The nospam command can be used to write exceptions to spam patterns. If a
       header pattern matches something in a spam command, but you nonetheless do not
       want it to receive a spam tag, you can list a more precise pattern under a
       nospam command.

       If the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n given to nospam is exactly the same as the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n on an exist-
       ing spam list entry, the effect will be to remove the entry from the spam list,
       instead of adding an exception.  Likewise, if the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n for a spam command
       matches an entry on the nospam list, that nospam entry will be removed. If the
       _p_a_t_t_e_r_n for nospam is ``*'', _a_l_l _e_n_t_r_i_e_s _o_n _b_o_t_h _l_i_s_t_s will be removed. This
       might be the default action if you use spam and nospam in conjunction with a
       folder-hook.

       You can have as many spam or nospam commands as you like.  You can even do your
       own primitive spam detection within mutt -- for example, if you consider all
       mail from MAILER-DAEMON to be spam, you can use a spam command like this:

            spam "^From: .*MAILER-DAEMON"       "999"

       _3_._2_5  _S_e_t_t_i_n_g _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s

       Usage: toggle _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e [_v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e ... ]

       Usage: unset _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e [_v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e ... ]

       Usage: reset _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e [_v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e ... ]

       This command is used to set (and unset) _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_a_t_i_o_n _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s (section 6.3  ,
       page 65).  There are four basic types of variables: boolean, number, string and
       quadoption.  _b_o_o_l_e_a_n variables can be _s_e_t (true) or _u_n_s_e_t (false).  _n_u_m_b_e_r
       variables can be assigned a positive integer value.

       _s_t_r_i_n_g variables consist of any number of printable characters.  _s_t_r_i_n_g_s must
       be enclosed in quotes if they contain spaces or tabs.  You may also use the
       ``C'' escape sequences \\nn and \\tt for newline and tab, respectively.

       _q_u_a_d_o_p_t_i_o_n variables are used to control whether or not to be prompted for cer-
       tain actions, or to specify a default action.  A value of _y_e_s will cause the
       action to be carried out automatically as if you had answered yes to the

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    32

       question.  Similarly, a value of _n_o will cause the the action to be carried out
       as if you had answered ``no.''  A value of _a_s_k_-_y_e_s will cause a prompt with a
       default answer of ``yes'' and _a_s_k_-_n_o will provide a default answer of ``no.''

       Prefixing a variable with ``no'' will unset it.  Example: set noaskbcc.

       For _b_o_o_l_e_a_n variables, you may optionally prefix the variable name with inv to
       toggle the value (on or off).  This is useful when writing macros.  Example:
       set invsmart_wrap.

       The toggle command automatically prepends the inv prefix to all specified vari-
       ables.

       The unset command automatically prepends the no prefix to all specified vari-
       ables.

       Using the enter-command function in the _i_n_d_e_x menu, you can query the value of
       a variable by prefixing the name of the variable with a question mark:

            set ?allow_8bit

       The question mark is actually only required for boolean and quadoption vari-
       ables.

       The reset command resets all given variables to the compile time defaults
       (hopefully mentioned in this manual). If you use the command set and prefix the
       variable with ``&'' this has the same behavior as the reset command.

       With the reset command there exists the special variable ``all'', which allows
       you to reset all variables to their system defaults.

       This command allows the inclusion of initialization commands from other files.
       For example, I place all of my aliases in ~/.mail_aliases so that I can make my
       ~/.muttrc readable and keep my aliases private.

       If the filename begins with a tilde (``~''), it will be expanded to the path of
       your home directory.

       If the filename ends with a vertical bar (|), then _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is considered to be
       an executable program from which to read input (eg.  source ~/bin/myscript|).

       ifdef (short for ``if defined'') only executes the command upon availability
       while ifndef (short for ``if not defined'') does if not. The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d may be any
       valid fraction of a configuration file.

       All names of variables, functions and menus may be tested. Additionally, the
       following compile-features may be tested when prefixed with 'feature_':
       ncurses, slang, iconv, idn, dotlock, standalone, pop, nntp, imap, ssl, gnutls,
       sasl, sasl2, libesmtp, compressed, color, classic_pgp, classic_smime, gpgme,

       Examples follow.

       To only source a file with IMAP related settings if IMAP support is compiled
       in, use:

            ifdef feature_imap 'source ~/.mutt-ng/imap_setup'
            # or
            # ifdef imap_user 'source ~/.mutt-ng/imap_setup'
            # or
            # ...

       To exit mutt-ng directly if no NNTP support is compiled in:

       (section 4.2  , page 36) must be specified using regular expressions (regexp)
       in the ``POSIX extended'' syntax (which is more or less the syntax used by
       egrep and GNU awk).  For your convenience, we have included below a brief
       description of this syntax.

       The search is case sensitive if the pattern contains at least one upper case
       letter, and case insensitive otherwise. Note that ``\'' must be quoted if used
       for a regular expression in an initialization command: ``\\''.

       A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings.  Regular
       expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic expressions, by using
       various operators to combine smaller expressions.

       Note that the regular expression can be enclosed/delimited by either ' or '
       which is useful if the regular expression includes a white-space character.
       See _S_y_n_t_a_x _o_f _I_n_i_t_i_a_l_i_z_a_t_i_o_n _F_i_l_e_s (section 3.1  , page 14) for more informa-
       tion on ' and ' delimiter processing.  To match a literal ' or ' you must pref-
       ace it with \ (backslash).

       The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match a single
       character.  Most characters, including all letters and digits, are regular
       expressions that match themselves.  Any metacharacter with special meaning may
       be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.

       The period ``.'' matches any single character.  The caret ``^'' and the dollar
       sign ``$'' are metacharacters that respectively match the empty string at the
       beginning and end of a line.

       A list of characters enclosed by ``['' and ``]'' matches any single character
       in that list; if the first character of the list is a caret ``^'' then it
       matches any character nnoott in the list.  For example, the regular expression
       [[00112233445566778899]] matches any single digit.  A range of ASCII characters may be
       specified by giving the first and last characters, separated by a hyphen ``-''.
       Most metacharacters lose their special meaning inside lists.  To include a lit-
       eral ``]'' place it first in the list.  Similarly, to include a literal ``^''
       place it anywhere but first.  Finally, to include a literal hyphen ``-'' place
       it last.

       Certain named classes of characters are predefined.  Character classes consist
       of ``[:'', a keyword denoting the class, and ``:]''.  The following classes are
       defined by the POSIX standard:

             [:alnum:]
                   Alphanumeric characters.

             [:alpha:]
                   Alphabetic characters.

             [:blank:]
                   Space or tab characters.

             [:cntrl:]
                   Control characters.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    35

             [:digit:]
                   Numeric characters.

             [:graph:]
                   Characters that are both printable and visible.  (A space is print-
                   able, but not visible, while an ``a'' is both.)

             [:lower:]
                   Lower-case alphabetic characters.

             [:print:]
                   Printable characters (characters that are not control characters.)

             [:punct:]
                   Punctuation characters (characters that are not letter, digits,
                   control characters, or space characters).

             [:space:]
                   Space characters (such as space, tab and formfeed, to name a few).

             [:upper:]
                   Upper-case alphabetic characters.

             [:xdigit:]
                   Characters that are hexadecimal digits.

       A character class is only valid in a regular expression inside the brackets of
       a character list.  Note that the brackets in these class names are part of the
       symbolic names, and must be included in addition to the brackets delimiting the
       bracket list.  For example, [[[[::ddiiggiitt::]]]] is equivalent to [[00--99]].

       Two additional special sequences can appear in character lists.  These apply to
       non-ASCII character sets, which can have single symbols (called collating ele-
       ments) that are represented with more than one character, as well as several
       characters that are equivalent for collating or sorting purposes:

             Collating Symbols
                   A collating symbol is a multi-character collating element enclosed
                   in ``[.'' and ``.]''.  For example, if ``ch'' is a collating ele-
                   ment, then [[[[..cchh..]]]] is a regexp that matches this collating ele-
                   ment, while [[cchh]] is a regexp that matches either ``c'' or ``h''.

             Equivalence Classes
                   An equivalence class is a locale-specific name for a list of char-
                   acters that are equivalent. The name is enclosed in ``[='' and
                   ``=]''.  For example, the name ``e'' might be used to represent all
                   of ``'' ``'' and ``e''.  In this case, [[[[==ee==]]]] is a regexp that
                   matches any of ``'', ``'' and ``e''.

       A regular expression matching a single character may be followed by one of sev-
       eral repetition operators:

             ?
                   The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    36

             *
                   The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.

             +
                   The preceding item will be matched one or more times.

             {n}
                   The preceding item is matched exactly _n times.

             {n,}
                   The preceding item is matched _n or more times.

             {,m}
                   The preceding item is matched at most _m times.

             {n,m}
                   The preceding item is matched at least _n times, but no more than _m
                   times.

       Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular expression
       matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings that respectively
       match the concatenated subexpressions.

       Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator ``|''; the result-
       ing regular expression matches any string matching either subexpression.

       Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes precedence
       over alternation.  A whole subexpression may be enclosed in parentheses to
       override these precedence rules.

       NNoottee:: If you compile Mutt-ng with the GNU _r_x package, the following operators
       may also be used in regular expressions:

             \\y
                   Matches the empty string at either the beginning or the end of a
                   word.

             \\B
                   Matches the empty string within a word.

             \\<
                   Matches the empty string at the beginning of a word.

             \\>
                   Matches the empty string at the end of a word.

             \\w
                   Matches any word-constituent character (letter, digit, or under-
                   score).

             \\W
                   Matches any character that is not word-constituent.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    37

             \\`
                   Matches the empty string at the beginning of a buffer (string).

             \\'
                   Matches the empty string at the end of a buffer.

       Please note however that these operators are not defined by POSIX, so they may
       or may not be available in stock libraries on various systems.

       33).  Special attention has to be made when using regular expressions inside of
       patterns.  Specifically, Mutt-ng's parser for these patterns will strip one
       level of backslash (\), which is normally used for quoting.  If it is your
       intention to use a backslash in the regular expression, you will need to use
       two backslashes instead (\\).

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    39

       *) The forms <[MAX], >[MIN], [MIN]- and -[MAX] are allowed, too.

       Note that patterns matching 'lists' of addresses (notably c,C,p,P and t) match
       if there is at least one match in the whole list. If you want to make sure that
       all elements of that list match, you need to prefix your pattern with ^.  This
       example matches all mails which only has recipients from Germany.

            ^~C \.de$

       _4_._2_._2  _C_o_m_p_l_e_x _P_a_t_t_e_r_n_s

       Logical AND is performed by specifying more than one criterion.  For example:

            ~t mutt ~f elkins

       would select messages which contain the word ``mutt'' in the list of recipients
       aanndd that have the word ``elkins'' in the ``From'' header field.

       Mutt-ng also recognizes the following operators to create more complex search
       patterns:

          +o ! -- logical NOT operator

          +o | -- logical OR operator

          +o () -- logical grouping operator

       Here is an example illustrating a complex search pattern.  This pattern will
       select all messages which do not contain ``mutt'' in the ``To'' or ``Cc'' field
       and which are from ``elkins''.

            !(~t mutt|~c mutt) ~f elkins

       Here is an example using white space in the regular expression (note the ' and
       ' delimiters).  For this to match, the mail's subject must match the ``^Junk
       +From +Me$'' and it must be from either ``Jim +Somebody'' or ``Ed +Some-
       oneElse'':

             '~s "^Junk +From +Me$" ~f ("Jim +Somebody"|"Ed +SomeoneElse")'

       Note that if a regular expression contains parenthesis, or a vertical bar
       ("|"), you mmuusstt enclose the expression in double or single quotes since those
       characters are also used to separate different parts of Mutt-ng's pattern lan-
       guage.  For example,

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    40

            ~f "me@(mutt\.org|cs\.hmc\.edu)"

       Without the quotes, the parenthesis wouldn't end.  This would be separated to
       two OR'd patterns: _~_f _m_e_@_(_m_u_t_t_\_._o_r_g and _c_s_\_._h_m_c_\_._e_d_u_). They are never what you
       want.

       _4_._2_._3  _S_e_a_r_c_h_i_n_g _b_y _D_a_t_e

       Mutt-ng supports two types of dates, _a_b_s_o_l_u_t_e and _r_e_l_a_t_i_v_e.

       AAbbssoolluuttee.  Dates mmuusstt be in DD/MM/YY format (month and year are optional,
       defaulting to the current month and year).  An example of a valid range of
       dates is:

            Limit to messages matching: ~d 20/1/95-31/10

       If you omit the minimum (first) date, and just specify ``-DD/MM/YY'', all mes-
       sages _b_e_f_o_r_e the given date will be selected.  If you omit the maximum (second)
       date, and specify ``DD/MM/YY-'', all messages _a_f_t_e_r the given date will be
       selected.  If you specify a single date with no dash (``-''), only messages
       sent on the given date will be selected.

       EErrrroorr MMaarrggiinnss.  You can add error margins to absolute dates.  An error margin
       is a sign (+ or -), followed by a digit, followed by one of the following
       units:

            y    years
            m    months
            w    weeks
            d    days

       As a special case, you can replace the sign by a ``*'' character, which is
       equivalent to giving identical plus and minus error margins.

       Example: To select any messages two weeks around January 15, 2001, you'd use
       the following pattern:

            Limit to messages matching: ~d 15/1/2001*2w

       RReellaattiivvee.  This type of date is relative to the current date, and may be speci-
       fied as:

          +o >_o_f_f_s_e_t (messages older than _o_f_f_s_e_t units)

          +o <_o_f_f_s_e_t (messages newer than _o_f_f_s_e_t units)

          +o =_o_f_f_s_e_t (messages exactly _o_f_f_s_e_t units old)

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    41

       _o_f_f_s_e_t is specified as a positive number with one of the following units:

            y       years
            m       months
            w       weeks
            d       days

       Example: to select messages less than 1 month old, you would use

            Limit to messages matching: ~d <1m

       NNoottee:: all dates used when searching are relative to the llooccaall time zone, so
       unless you change the setting of your _$_i_n_d_e_x___f_o_r_m_a_t (section 6.3.110  , page
       90) to include a %[...] format, these are nnoott the dates shown in the main
       index.

       _4_._3  _U_s_i_n_g _T_a_g_s

       Sometimes it is desirable to perform an operation on a group of messages all at
       once rather than one at a time.  An example might be to save messages to a
       mailing list to a separate folder, or to delete all messages with a given sub-
       ject.  To tag all messages matching a pattern, use the tag-pattern function,
       which is bound to ``shift-T'' by default.  Or you can select individual mes-
       sages by hand using the ``tag-message'' function, which is bound to ``t'' by
       default.  See _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s (section 4.2  , page 36) for Mutt-ng's pattern matching
       syntax.

       Once you have tagged the desired messages, you can use the ``tag-prefix'' oper-
       ator, which is the ``;'' (semicolon) key by default.  When the ``tag-prefix''
       operator is used, the nneexxtt operation will be applied to all tagged messages if
       that operation can be used in that manner.  If the _$_a_u_t_o___t_a_g (section 6.3.16  ,
       page 69) variable is set, the next operation applies to the tagged messages
       automatically, without requiring the ``tag-prefix''.

       In _m_a_c_r_o_s (section 3.6  , page 20) or _p_u_s_h (section 3.21  , page 29) commands,
       you can use the ``tag-prefix-cond'' operator.  If there are no tagged messages,
       mutt will "eat" the rest of the macro to abort it's execution.  Mutt-ng will
       stop "eating" the macro when it encounters the ``end-cond'' operator;  after
       this operator the rest of the macro will be executed as normal.

       _4_._4  _U_s_i_n_g _H_o_o_k_s

       A _h_o_o_k is a concept borrowed from the EMACS editor which allows you to execute
       arbitrary commands before performing some operation.  For example, you may wish
       to tailor your configuration based upon which mailbox you are reading, or to
       whom you are sending mail.  In the Mutt-ng world, a _h_o_o_k consists of a _r_e_g_u_l_a_r
       _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n (section 4.1  , page 33) or _p_a_t_t_e_r_n (section 4.2  , page 36) along
       with a configuration option/command.  See

       NNoottee:: if a hook changes configuration settings, these changes remain effective
       until the end of the current mutt session. As this is generally not desired, a
       default hook needs to be added before all other hooks to restore configuration
       defaults. Here is an example with send-hook and the my_hdr directive:

            send-hook . 'unmy_hdr From:'
            send-hook ~C'^b@b\.b$' my_hdr from: c@c.c

       _4_._4_._1  _M_e_s_s_a_g_e _M_a_t_c_h_i_n_g _i_n _H_o_o_k_s

       Hooks that act upon messages (send-hook, save-hook, fcc-hook, message-hook) are
       evaluated in a slightly different manner.  For the other types of hooks, a _r_e_g_-
       _u_l_a_r _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n (section 4.1  , page 33) is sufficient.  But in dealing with
       messages a finer grain of control is needed for matching since for different
       purposes you want to match different criteria.

       Mutt-ng allows the use of the _s_e_a_r_c_h _p_a_t_t_e_r_n (section 4.2  , page 36) language
       for matching messages in hook commands.  This works in exactly the same way as
       it would when _l_i_m_i_t_i_n_g or _s_e_a_r_c_h_i_n_g the mailbox, except that you are restricted
       to those operators which match information mutt extracts from the header of the
       message (i.e.  from, to, cc, date, subject, etc.).

       For example, if you wanted to set your return address based upon sending mail
       to a specific address, you could do something like:

            send-hook '~t ^me@cs\.hmc\.edu$' 'my_hdr From: Mutt-ng User <user@host>'

       which would execute the given command when sending mail to _m_e_@_c_s_._h_m_c_._e_d_u.

       However, it is not required that you write the pattern to match using the full
       searching language.  You can still specify a simple _r_e_g_u_l_a_r _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n like the
       other hooks, in which case Mutt-ng will translate your pattern into the full
       language, using the translation specified by the _$_d_e_f_a_u_l_t___h_o_o_k (section
       6.3.45  , page 75) variable.  The pattern is translated at the time the hook is
       declared, so the value of _$_d_e_f_a_u_l_t___h_o_o_k (section 6.3.45  , page 75) that is in
       effect at that time will be used.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    43

       The sidebar, a feature specific to Mutt-ng, allows you to use a mailbox listing
       which looks very similar to the ones you probably know from GUI mail clients.
       The sidebar lists all specified mailboxes, shows the number in each and high-
       lights the ones with new email Use the following configuration commands:

            set sidebar_visible="yes"
            set sidebar_width=25

       If you want to specify the mailboxes you can do so with:

            set mbox='=INBOX'
            mailboxes INBOX \
                      MBOX1 \
                      MBOX2 \
                      ...

       You can also specify the colors for mailboxes with new mails by using:

            color sidebar_new red black
            color sidebar white black

       The available functions are:

            sidebar-scroll-up      Scrolls the mailbox list up 1 page
            sidebar-scroll-down    Scrolls the mailbox list down 1 page
            sidebar-next           Highlights the next mailbox
            sidebar-next-new       Highlights the next mailbox with new mail
            sidebar-previous       Highlights the previous mailbox
            sidebar-open           Opens the currently highlighted mailbox

       Reasonable key bindings look e.g. like this:

            bind index \Cp sidebar-prev
            bind index \Cn sidebar-next
            bind index \Cb sidebar-open
            bind pager \Cp sidebar-prev
            bind pager \Cn sidebar-next
            bind pager \Cb sidebar-open

            macro index B ':toggle sidebar_visible^M'
            macro pager B ':toggle sidebar_visible^M'

       You can then go up and down by pressing Ctrl-P and Ctrl-N, and switch on and
       off the sidebar simply by pressing 'B'.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    44

       Mutt-ng supports connecting to external directory databases such as LDAP,
       ph/qi, bbdb, or NIS through a wrapper script which connects to mutt using a
       simple interface.  Using the _$_q_u_e_r_y___c_o_m_m_a_n_d (section 6.3.221  , page 118) vari-
       able, you specify the wrapper command to use.  For example:

            set query_command = "mutt_ldap_query.pl '%s'"

       The wrapper script should accept the query on the command-line.  It should
       return a one line message, then each matching response on a single line, each
       line containing a tab separated address then name then some other optional
       information.  On error, or if there are no matching addresses, return a non-
       zero exit code and a one line error message.

       An example multiple response output:

            Searching database ... 20 entries ... 3 matching:
            me@cs.hmc.edu           Michael Elkins  mutt dude
            blong@fiction.net       Brandon Long    mutt and more
            roessler@guug.de        Thomas Roessler mutt pgp

       There are two mechanisms for accessing the query function of mutt.  One is to
       do a query from the index menu using the query function (default: Q).  This
       will prompt for a query, then bring up the query menu which will list the
       matching responses.  From the query menu, you can select addresses to create
       aliases, or to mail.  You can tag multiple addresses to mail, start a new
       query, or have a new query appended to the current responses.

       The other mechanism for accessing the query function is for address completion,
       similar to the alias completion.  In any prompt for address entry, you can use
       the complete-query function (default: ^T) to run a query based on the current
       address you have typed.  Like aliases, mutt will look for what you have typed
       back to the last space or comma.  If there is a single response for that query,
       mutt will expand the address in place.  If there are multiple responses, mutt
       will activate the query menu.  At the query menu, you can select one or more
       addresses to be added to the prompt.

       Mutt-ng supports reading and writing of four different mailbox formats: mbox,
       MMDF, MH and Maildir.  The mailbox type is autodetected, so there is no need to
       use a flag for different mailbox types.  When creating new mailboxes, Mutt-ng
       uses the default specified with the _$_m_b_o_x___t_y_p_e (section 6.3.125  , page 95)
       variable.

       mmbbooxx.  This is the most widely used mailbox format for UNIX.  All messages are
       stored in a single file.  Each message has a line of the form:

            From me@cs.hmc.edu Fri, 11 Apr 1997 11:44:56 PST

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    45

       to denote the start of a new message (this is often referred to as the
       ``From_'' line).

       MMMMDDFF.  This is a variant of the _m_b_o_x format.  Each message is surrounded by
       lines containing ``^A^A^A^A'' (four control-A's).

       MMHH. A radical departure from _m_b_o_x and _M_M_D_F, a mailbox consists of a directory
       and each message is stored in a separate file.  The filename indicates the mes-
       sage number (however, this is may not correspond to the message number Mutt-ng
       displays). Deleted messages are renamed with a comma (,) prepended to the file-
       name. NNoottee:: Mutt detects this type of mailbox by looking for either
       .mh_sequences or .xmhcache (needed to distinguish normal directories from MH
       mailboxes).

       MMaaiillddiirr.  The newest of the mailbox formats, used by the Qmail MTA (a replace-
       ment for sendmail).  Similar to _M_H, except that it adds three subdirectories of
       the mailbox: _t_m_p, _n_e_w and _c_u_r.  Filenames for the messages are chosen in such a
       way they are unique, even when two programs are writing the mailbox over NFS,
       which means that no file locking is needed.

       There are a number of built in shortcuts which refer to specific mailboxes.
       These shortcuts can be used anywhere you are prompted for a file or mailbox
       path.

          +o ! -- refers to your _$_s_p_o_o_l_f_i_l_e (section 6.3.295  , page 136) (incoming)

            determined by the address of the alias

       Mutt-ng has a few configuration options that make dealing with large amounts of
       mail easier.  The first thing you must do is to let Mutt know what addresses
       you consider to be mailing lists (technically this does not have to be a mail-
       ing list, but that is what it is most often used for), and what lists you are
       subscribed to.  This is accomplished through the use of the _l_i_s_t_s _a_n_d _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_b_e
       (section 3.10  , page 24) commands in your muttrc.

       Now that Mutt-ng knows what your mailing lists are, it can do several things,

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    46

       the first of which is the ability to show the name of a list through which you
       received a message (i.e., of a subscribed list) in the _i_n_d_e_x menu display.
       This is useful to distinguish between personal and list mail in the same mail-
       box.  In the _$_i_n_d_e_x___f_o_r_m_a_t (section 6.3.110  , page 90) variable, the escape
       ``%L'' will return the string ``To <list>'' when ``list'' appears in the ``To''
       field, and ``Cc <list>'' when it appears in the ``Cc'' field (otherwise it
       returns the name of the author).

       Often times the ``To'' and ``Cc'' fields in mailing list messages tend to get
       quite large. Most people do not bother to remove the author of the message they
       are reply to from the list, resulting in two or more copies being sent to that
       person.  The ``list-reply'' function, which by default is bound to ``L'' in the
       _i_n_d_e_x menu and _p_a_g_e_r, helps reduce the clutter by only replying to the known
       mailing list addresses instead of all recipients (except as specified by Mail-
       Followup-To, see below).

       Mutt-ng also supports the Mail-Followup-To header.  When you send a message to
       a list of recipients which includes one or several subscribed mailing lists,
       and if the _$_f_o_l_l_o_w_u_p___t_o (section 6.3.66  , page 80) option is set, mutt will
       generate a Mail-Followup-To header which contains all the recipients to whom
       you send this message, but not your address. This indicates that group-replies
       or list-replies (also known as ``followups'') to this message should only be
       sent to the original recipients of the message, and not separately to you -
       you'll receive your copy through one of the mailing lists you are subscribed
       to.

       Conversely, when group-replying or list-replying to a message which has a Mail-
       Followup-To header, mutt will respect this header if the _$_h_o_n_o_r___f_o_l_l_o_w_u_p___t_o
       (section 6.3.88  , page 85) configuration variable is set.  Using list-reply
       will in this case also make sure that the reply goes to the mailing list, even
       if it's not specified in the list of recipients in the Mail-Followup-To.

       Note that, when header editing is enabled, you can create a Mail-Followup-To
       header manually.  Mutt-ng will only auto-generate this header if it doesn't
       exist when you send the message.

       The other method some mailing list admins use is to generate a ``Reply-To''
       field which points back to the mailing list address rather than the author of
       the message.  This can create problems when trying to reply directly to the
       author in private, since most mail clients will automatically reply to the
       address given in the ``Reply-To'' field.  Mutt-ng uses the _$_r_e_p_l_y___t_o (section
       6.3.233  , page 121) variable to help decide which address to use.  If set to
       _a_s_k_-_y_e_s or _a_s_k_-_n_o, you will be prompted as to whether or not you would like to
       use the address given in the ``Reply-To'' field, or reply directly to the
       address given in the ``From'' field.  When set to _y_e_s, the ``Reply-To'' field
       will be used when present.

       The ``X-Label:'' header field can be used to further identify mailing lists or
       list subject matter (or just to annotate messages individually).  The
       _$_i_n_d_e_x___f_o_r_m_a_t (section 6.3.110  , page 90) variable's ``%y'' and ``%Y'' escapes
       can be used to expand ``X-Label:'' fields in the index, and Mutt-ng's pattern-
       matcher can match regular expressions to ``X-Label:'' fields with the `` y''
       selector.  ``X-Label:'' is not a standard message header field, but it can eas-
       ily be inserted by procmail and other mail filtering agents.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    47

       Lastly, Mutt-ng has the ability to _s_o_r_t (section 6.3.289  , page 134) the mail-
       box into _t_h_r_e_a_d_s (section 2.3.3  , page 7).  A thread is a group of messages
       which all relate to the same subject.  This is usually organized into a tree-
       like structure where a message and all of its replies are represented graphi-
       cally.  If you've ever used a threaded news client, this is the same concept.
       It makes dealing with large volume mailing lists easier because you can easily
       delete uninteresting threads and quickly find topics of value.

       Mutt-ng has the ability to dynamically restructure threads that are broken
       either by misconfigured software or bad behavior from some correspondents. This
       allows to clean your mailboxes formats) from these annoyances which make it
       hard to follow a discussion.

       Some mailers tend to "forget" to correctly set the "In-Reply-To:" and "Refer-
       ences:" headers when replying to a message. This results in broken discussions
       because Mutt-ng has not enough information to guess the correct threading.  You
       can fix this by tagging the reply, then moving to the parent message and using
       the ``link-threads'' function (bound to & by default). The reply will then be
       connected to this "parent" message.

       You can also connect multiple children at once, tagging them and using the tag-
       prefix command (';') or the auto_tag option.

       On mailing lists, some people are in the bad habit of starting a new discussion
       by hitting "reply" to any message from the list and changing the subject to a
       totally unrelated one.  You can fix such threads by using the ``break-thread''
       function (bound by default to #), which will turn the subthread starting from
       the current message into a whole different thread.

       RFC1894 defines a set of MIME content types for relaying information about the
       status of electronic mail messages.  These can be thought of as ``return
       receipts.'' Berkeley sendmail 8.8.x currently has some command line options in
       which the mail client can make requests as to what type of status messages
       should be returned.

       To support this, there are two variables. _$_d_s_n___n_o_t_i_f_y (section 6.3.51  , page
       76) is used to request receipts for different results (such as failed message,
       message delivered, etc.).  _$_d_s_n___r_e_t_u_r_n (section 6.3.52  , page 76) requests how
       much of your message should be returned with the receipt (headers or full mes-
       sage).  Refer to the man page on sendmail for more details on DSN.

       If Mutt-ng was compiled with POP3 support (by running the _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e script with
       the _-_-_e_n_a_b_l_e_-_p_o_p flag), it has the ability to work with mailboxes located on a
       remote POP3 server and fetch mail for local browsing.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    48

       You can access the remote POP3 mailbox by selecting the folder
       pop://popserver/.

       You can select an alternative port by specifying it with the server, i.e.:
       pop://popserver:port/.

       You can also specify different username for each folder, i.e.: pop://user-
       name@popserver[:port]/.

       Polling for new mail is more expensive over POP3 than locally. For this reason
       the frequency at which Mutt-ng will check for mail remotely can be controlled
       by the _$_p_o_p___m_a_i_l___c_h_e_c_k (section 6.3.208  , page 115) variable, which defaults
       to every 60 seconds.

       If Mutt-ng was compiled with SSL support (by running the _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e script with
       the _-_-_w_i_t_h_-_s_s_l flag), connections to POP3 servers can be encrypted. This natu-
       rally requires that the server supports SSL encrypted connections. To access a
       folder with POP3/SSL, you should use pops: prefix, ie: pops://[user-
       name@]popserver[:port]/.

       Another way to access your POP3 mail is the _f_e_t_c_h_-_m_a_i_l function (default: G).
       It allows to connect to _p_o_p___h_o_s_t (section 6.3.206  , page 115), fetch all your
       new mail and place it in the local _s_p_o_o_l_f_i_l_e (section 6.3.295  , page 136).
       After this point, Mutt-ng runs exactly as if the mail had always been local.

       NNoottee:: If you only need to fetch all messages to local mailbox you should con-
       sider using a specialized program, such as fetchmail

       If Mutt-ng was compiled with IMAP support (by running the _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e script with
       the _-_-_e_n_a_b_l_e_-_i_m_a_p flag), it has the ability to work with folders located on a
       remote IMAP server.

       You can access the remote inbox by selecting the folder
       imap://imapserver/INBOX, where imapserver is the name of the IMAP server and
       INBOX is the special name for your spool mailbox on the IMAP server. If you
       want to access another mail folder at the IMAP server, you should use
       imap://imapserver/path/to/folder where path/to/folder is the path of the folder
       you want to access.

       You can select an alternative port by specifying it with the server, i.e.:
       imap://imapserver:port/INBOX.

       You can also specify different username for each folder, i.e.: imap://user-
       name@imapserver[:port]/INBOX.

       If Mutt-ng was compiled with SSL support (by running the _c_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e script with
       the _-_-_w_i_t_h_-_s_s_l flag), connections to IMAP servers can be encrypted. This natu-
       rally requires that the server supports SSL encrypted connections. To access a
       folder with IMAP/SSL, you should use imaps://[user-
       name@]imapserver[:port]/path/to/folder as your folder path.

       Pine-compatible notation is also supported, i.e.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    49

       {[username@]imapserver[:port][/ssl]}path/to/folder

       Note that not all servers use / as the hierarchy separator.  Mutt-ng should
       correctly notice which separator is being used by the server and convert paths
       accordingly.

       When browsing folders on an IMAP server, you can toggle whether to look at only
       the folders you are subscribed to, or all folders with the _t_o_g_g_l_e_-_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_b_e_d
       command.  See also the _$_i_m_a_p___l_i_s_t___s_u_b_s_c_r_i_b_e_d (section 6.3.97  , page 87) vari-
       able.

       Polling for new mail on an IMAP server can cause noticeable delays. So, you'll
       want to carefully tune the _$_i_m_a_p___m_a_i_l___c_h_e_c_k (section 6.3.99  , page 88) and
       _$_t_i_m_e_o_u_t (section 6.3.318  , page 142) variables.

       Note that if you are using mbox as the mail store on UW servers prior to
       v12.250, the server has been reported to disconnect a client if another client
       selects the same folder.

       As of version 1.2, mutt supports browsing mailboxes on an IMAP server. This is
       mostly the same as the local file browser, with the following differences:

          +o Instead of file permissions, mutt displays the string "IMAP", possibly
            followed by the symbol "+", indicating that the entry contains both mes-
            sages and subfolders. On Cyrus-like servers folders will often contain
            both messages and subfolders.

          +o For the case where an entry can contain both messages and subfolders, the
            selection key (bound to enter by default) will choose to descend into the
            subfolder view. If you wish to view the messages in that folder, you must
            use view-file instead (bound to space by default).

          +o You can create, delete and rename mailboxes with the create-mailbox,
            delete-mailbox, and rename-mailbox commands (default bindings: C, d and r,
            respectively). You may also subscribe and unsubscribe to mailboxes (nor-
            mally these are bound to s and u, respectively).

       Mutt-ng supports four authentication methods with IMAP servers: SASL, GSSAPI,
       CRAM-MD5, and LOGIN (there is a patch by Grant Edwards to add NTLM authentica-
       tion for you poor exchange users out there, but it has yet to be integrated
       into the main tree). There is also support for the pseudo-protocol ANONYMOUS,
       which allows you to log in to a public IMAP server without having an account.
       To use ANONYMOUS, simply make your username blank or "anonymous".

       SASL is a special super-authenticator, which selects among several protocols
       (including GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, ANONYMOUS, and DIGEST-MD5) the most secure method
       available on your host and the server. Using some of these methods (including
       DIGEST-MD5 and possibly GSSAPI), your entire session will be encrypted and
       invisible to those teeming network snoops. It is the best option if you have
       it. To use it, you must have the Cyrus SASL library installed on your system

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    50

       and compile mutt with the _-_-_w_i_t_h_-_s_a_s_l flag.

       Mutt-ng will try whichever methods are compiled in and available on the server,
       in the following order: SASL, ANONYMOUS, GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, LOGIN.

       There are a few variables which control authentication:

          +o _$_i_m_a_p___u_s_e_r (section 6.3.105  , page 89) - controls the username under
            which you request authentication on the IMAP server, for all authentica-
            tors. This is overridden by an explicit username in the mailbox path (i.e.
            by using a mailbox name of the form {user@host}).

            of IMAP authentication methods to try, in the order you wish to try them.
            If specified, this overrides mutt's default (attempt everything, in the
            order listed above).

       If you happen to have accounts on multiple IMAP and/or POP servers, you may
       find managing all the authentication settings inconvenient and error-prone.
       The account-hook command may help. This hook works like folder-hook but is
       invoked whenever you access a remote mailbox (including inside the folder
       browser), not just when you open the mailbox.

       Some examples:

            account-hook . 'unset imap_user; unset imap_pass; unset tunnel'
            account-hook imap://host1/ 'set imap_user=me1 imap_pass=foo'
            account-hook imap://host2/ 'set tunnel="ssh host2 /usr/libexec/imapd"'

       If a message contains URLs (_u_n_i_f_i_e_d _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e _l_o_c_a_t_o_r = address in the WWW space
       like _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_w_w_w_._m_u_t_t_._o_r_g_/), it is efficient to get a menu with all the URLs and
       start a WWW browser on one of them.  This functionality is provided by the
       external urlview program which can be retrieved at ftp://ftp.mutt.org/mutt/con-
       trib/ and the configuration commands:

            macro index \cb |urlview\n
            macro pager \cb |urlview\n

       _4_._1_6  _C_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_e_d _f_o_l_d_e_r_s _S_u_p_p_o_r_t _(_O_P_T_I_O_N_A_L_)

       If Mutt-ng was compiled with compressed folders support (by running the _c_o_n_f_i_g_-
       _u_r_e script with the _-_-_e_n_a_b_l_e_-_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_e_d flag), Mutt can open folders stored in
       an arbitrary format, provided that the user has a script to convert from/to
       this format to one of the accepted.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    51

       The most common use is to open compressed archived folders e.g. with gzip.

       In addition, the user can provide a script that gets a folder in an accepted
       format and appends its context to the folder in the user-defined format, which
       may be faster than converting the entire folder to the accepted format, append-
       ing to it and converting back to the user-defined format.

       There are three hooks defined (_o_p_e_n_-_h_o_o_k (section 4.16.1  , page 50), _c_l_o_s_e_-
       _h_o_o_k (section 4.16.2  , page 51) and _a_p_p_e_n_d_-_h_o_o_k (section 4.16.3  , page 51))
       which define commands to uncompress and compress a folder and to append mes-
       sages to an existing compressed folder respectively.

       For example:

            open-hook \\.gz$ "gzip -cd %f > %t"
            close-hook \\.gz$ "gzip -c %t > %f"
            append-hook \\.gz$ "gzip -c %t >> %f"

       You do not have to specify all of the commands. If you omit _a_p_p_e_n_d_-_h_o_o_k (sec-
       tion 4.16.3  , page 51), the folder will be open and closed again each time you
       will add to it. If you omit _c_l_o_s_e_-_h_o_o_k (section 4.16.2  , page 51) (or give
       empty command) , the folder will be open in the  mode. If you specify _a_p_p_e_n_d_-
       _h_o_o_k (section 4.16.3  , page 51) though you'll be able to append to the folder.

       Note that Mutt-ng will only try to use hooks if the file is not in one of the
       accepted formats. In particular, if the file is empty, mutt supposes it is not
       compressed. This is important because it allows the use of programs that do not
       have well defined extensions. Just use '.' as a regexp. But this may be sur-
       prising if your compressing script produces empty files. In this situation,
       unset _$_s_a_v_e___e_m_p_t_y (section 6.3.240  , page 123), so that the compressed file
       will be removed if you delete all of the messages.

       Usage: open-hook _r_e_g_e_x_p '_c_o_m_m_a_n_d'

       The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is the command that can be used for opening the folders whose names
       match _r_e_g_e_x_p.

       The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d string is the printf-like format string, and it should accept two
       parameters: %f, which is replaced with the (compressed) folder name, and %t
       which is replaced with the name of the temporary folder to which to write.

       %f and %t can be repeated any number of times in the command string, and all of
       the entries are replaced with the appropriate folder name. In addition, %% is
       replaced by %, as in printf, and any other %anything is left as is.

       The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d should nnoott remove the original compressed file.  The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d should
       return non-zero exit status if it fails, so mutt knows something's wrong.

       Example:

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    52

            open-hook \\.gz$ "gzip -cd %f > %t"

       If the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is empty, this operation is disabled for this file type.

       Usage: close-hook _r_e_g_e_x_p '_c_o_m_m_a_n_d'

       This is used to close the folder that was open with the _o_p_e_n_-_h_o_o_k (section
       4.16.1  , page 50) command after some changes were made to it.

       The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d string is the command that can be used for closing the folders
       whose names match _r_e_g_e_x_p. It has the same format as in the _o_p_e_n_-_h_o_o_k (section
       4.16.1  , page 50) command. Temporary folder in this case is the folder previ-
       ously produced by the <_o_p_e_n_-_h_o_o_k (section 4.16.1  , page 50) command.

       The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d should nnoott remove the decompressed file. The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d should return
       non-zero exit status if it fails, so mutt knows something's wrong.

       Example:

            close-hook \\.gz$ "gzip -c %t > %f"

       If the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is empty, this operation is disabled for this file type, and the
       file can only be open in the readonly mode.

       _c_l_o_s_e_-_h_o_o_k (section 4.16.2  , page 51) is not called when you exit from the
       folder if the folder was not changed.

       Usage: append-hook _r_e_g_e_x_p '_c_o_m_m_a_n_d'

       This command is used for saving to an existing compressed folder.  The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
       is the command that can be used for appending to the folders whose names match
       _r_e_g_e_x_p. It has the same format as in the _o_p_e_n_-_h_o_o_k (section 4.16.1  , page 50)
       command.  The temporary folder in this case contains the messages that are
       being appended.

       The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d should nnoott remove the decompressed file. The _c_o_m_m_a_n_d should return
       non-zero exit status if it fails, so mutt knows something's wrong.

       Example:

            append-hook \\.gz$ "gzip -c %t >> %f"

       When _a_p_p_e_n_d_-_h_o_o_k (section 4.16.3  , page 51) is used, the folder is not opened,
       which saves time, but this means that we can not find out what the folder type
       is. Thus the default (_$_m_b_o_x___t_y_p_e (section 6.3.125  , page 95)) type is always

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    53

       supposed (i.e.  this is the format used for the temporary folder).

       If the file does not exist when you save to it, _c_l_o_s_e_-_h_o_o_k (section 4.16.2  ,
       page 51) is called, and not _a_p_p_e_n_d_-_h_o_o_k (section 4.16.3  , page 51). _a_p_p_e_n_d_-
       _h_o_o_k (section 4.16.3  , page 51) is only for appending to existing folders.

       If the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is empty, this operation is disabled for this file type. In this
       case, the folder will be open and closed again (using _o_p_e_n_-_h_o_o_k (section
       4.16.1  , page 50) and _c_l_o_s_e_-_h_o_o_k (section 4.16.2  , page 51)respectively) each
       time you will add to it.

       The compressed folders support can also be used to handle encrypted folders. If
       you want to encrypt a folder with PGP, you may want to use the following hooks:

            open-hook  \\.pgp$ "pgp -f < %f > %t"
            close-hook \\.pgp$ "pgp -fe YourPgpUserIdOrKeyId < %t > %f"

       Please note, that PGP does not support appending to an encrypted folder, so
       there is no append-hook defined.

       NNoottee:: the folder is temporary stored decrypted in the /tmp directory, where it
       can be read by your system administrator. So think about the security aspects
       of this.

       Quite a bit of effort has been made to make Mutt-ng the premier text-mode MIME
       MUA.  Every effort has been made to provide the functionality that the discern-
       ing MIME user requires, and the conformance to the standards wherever possible.
       When configuring Mutt-ng for MIME, there are two extra types of configuration
       files which Mutt-ng uses.  One is the mime.types file, which contains the map-
       ping of file extensions to IANA MIME types.  The other is the mailcap file,
       which specifies the external commands to use for handling specific MIME types.

       _5_._1  _U_s_i_n_g _M_I_M_E _i_n _M_u_t_t

       There are three areas/menus in Mutt-ng which deal with MIME, they are the pager
       (while viewing a message), the attachment menu and the compose menu.

       _5_._1_._1  _V_i_e_w_i_n_g _M_I_M_E _m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s _i_n _t_h_e _p_a_g_e_r

       When you select a message from the index and view it in the pager, Mutt decodes
       the message to a text representation.  Mutt-ng internally supports a number of
       MIME types, including text/plain, text/enriched, message/rfc822, and mes-
       sage/news.  In addition, the export controlled version of Mutt-ng recognizes a
       variety of PGP MIME types, including PGP/MIME and application/pgp.

       Mutt-ng will denote attachments with a couple lines describing them.  These
       lines are of the form:

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    54

            [-- Attachment #1: Description --]
            [-- Type: text/plain, Encoding: 7bit, Size: 10000 --]

       Where the Description is the description or filename given for the attachment,
       and the Encoding is one of 7bit/8bit/quoted-printable/base64/binary.

       If Mutt-ng cannot deal with a MIME type, it will display a message like:

            [-- image/gif is unsupported (use 'v' to view this part) --]

       _5_._1_._2  _T_h_e _A_t_t_a_c_h_m_e_n_t _M_e_n_u

       The default binding for view-attachments is `v', which displays the attachment
       menu for a message.  The attachment menu displays a list of the attachments in
       a message.  From the attachment menu, you can save, print, pipe, delete, and
       view attachments.  You can apply these operations to a group of attachments at
       once, by tagging the attachments and by using the ``tag-prefix'' operator.  You
       can also reply to the current message from this menu, and only the current
       attachment (or the attachments tagged) will be quoted in your reply.  You can
       view attachments as text, or view them using the mailcap viewer definition.

       Finally, you can apply the usual message-related functions (like _r_e_s_e_n_d_-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e
       (section 2.3.4  , page 9), and the reply and forward functions) to attachments
       of type message/rfc822.

       See the help on the attachment menu for more information.

       The compose menu is the menu you see before you send a message.  It allows you
       to edit the recipient list, the subject, and other aspects of your message.  It
       also contains a list of the attachments of your message, including the main
       body.  From this menu, you can print, copy, filter, pipe, edit, compose,
       review, and rename an attachment or a list of tagged attachments.  You can also
       modifying the attachment information, notably the type, encoding and descrip-
       tion.

       Attachments appear as follows:

            -   1 [text/plain, 7bit, 1K]             /tmp/mutt-euler-8082-0 <no description>
                2 [applica/x-gunzip, base64, 422K]   ~/src/mutt-0.85.tar.gz <no description>

       The '-' denotes that Mutt-ng will delete the file after sending (or postponing,
       or canceling) the message.  It can be toggled with the toggle-unlink command
       (default: u).  The next field is the MIME content-type, and can be changed with
       the edit-type command (default: ^T).  The next field is the encoding for the
       attachment, which allows a binary message to be encoded for transmission on
       7bit links.  It can be changed with the edit-encoding command (default: ^E).
       The next field is the size of the attachment, rounded to kilobytes or
       megabytes.  The next field is the filename, which can be changed with the
       rename-file command (default: R).  The final field is the description of the

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    55

       attachment, and can be changed with the edit-description command (default: d).

       When you add an attachment to your mail message, Mutt-ng searches your personal
       mime.types file at ${HOME}/.mime.types, and then the system mime.types file at
       /usr/local/share/mutt/mime.types or /etc/mime.types

       The mime.types file consist of lines containing a MIME type and a space sepa-
       rated list of extensions.  For example:

            application/postscript          ps eps
            application/pgp                 pgp
            audio/x-aiff                    aif aifc aiff

       A sample mime.types file comes with the Mutt-ng distribution, and should con-
       tain most of the MIME types you are likely to use.

       If Mutt-ng can not determine the mime type by the extension of the file you
       attach, it will look at the file.  If the file is free of binary information,
       Mutt-ng will assume that the file is plain text, and mark it as text/plain.  If
       the file contains binary information, then Mutt-ng will mark it as applica-
       tion/octet-stream.  You can change the MIME type that Mutt-ng assigns to an
       attachment by using the edit-type command from the compose menu (default: ^T).
       The MIME type is actually a major mime type followed by the sub-type, separated
       by a '/'. 6 major types: application, text, image, video, audio, and model have
       been approved after various internet discussions. Mutt-ng recognises all of
       these if the appropriate entry is found in the mime.types file. It also recog-
       nises other major mime types, such as the chemical type that is widely used in
       the molecular modelling community to pass molecular data in various forms to
       various molecular viewers. Non-recognised mime types should only be used if the
       recipient of the message is likely to be expecting such attachments.

       Mutt-ng supports RFC 1524 MIME Configuration, in particular the Unix specific
       format specified in Appendix A of RFC 1524.  This file format is commonly
       referred to as the mailcap format.  Many MIME compliant programs utilize the
       mailcap format, allowing you to specify handling for all MIME types in one
       place for all programs.  Programs known to use this format include Netscape,
       XMosaic, lynx and metamail.

       In order to handle various MIME types that Mutt-ng can not handle internally,
       Mutt-ng parses a series of external configuration files to find an external
       handler.  The default search string for these files is a colon delimited list
       set to

            ${HOME}/.mailcap:/usr/local/share/mutt/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap

       where $HOME is your home directory.

       In particular, the metamail distribution will install a mailcap file, usually

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    56

       as /usr/local/etc/mailcap, which contains some baseline entries.

       _5_._3_._1  _T_h_e _B_a_s_i_c_s _o_f _t_h_e _m_a_i_l_c_a_p _f_i_l_e

       A mailcap file consists of a series of lines which are comments, blank, or def-
       initions.

       A comment line consists of a # character followed by anything you want.

       A blank line is blank.

       A definition line consists of a content type, a view command, and any number of
       optional fields.  Each field of a definition line is divided by a semicolon ';'
       character.

       The content type is specified in the MIME standard type/subtype method.  For
       example, text/plain, text/html, image/gif, etc.  In addition, the mailcap for-
       mat includes two formats for wildcards, one using the special '*' subtype, the
       other is the implicit wild, where you only include the major type.  For exam-
       ple, image/*, or video, will match all image types and video types, respec-
       tively.

       The view command is a Unix command for viewing the type specified. There are
       two different types of commands supported. The default is to send the body of
       the MIME message to the command on stdin. You can change this behavior by using
       %s as a parameter to your view command.  This will cause Mutt-ng to save the
       body of the MIME message to a temporary file, and then call the view command
       with the %s replaced by the name of the temporary file. In both cases, Mutt-ng
       will turn over the terminal to the view program until the program quits, at
       which time Mutt will remove the temporary file if it exists.

       So, in the simplest form, you can send a text/plain message to the external
       pager more on stdin:

            text/plain; more

       Or, you could send the message as a file:

            text/plain; more %s

       Perhaps you would like to use lynx to interactively view a text/html message:

            text/html; lynx %s

       In this case, lynx does not support viewing a file from stdin, so you must use
       the %s syntax.  NNoottee:: _S_o_m_e _o_l_d_e_r _v_e_r_s_i_o_n_s _o_f _l_y_n_x _c_o_n_t_a_i_n _a _b_u_g _w_h_e_r_e _t_h_e_y _w_i_l_l

       On the other hand, maybe you don't want to use lynx interactively, you just

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    57

       want to have it convert the text/html to text/plain, then you can use:

            text/html; lynx -dump %s | more

       Perhaps you wish to use lynx to view text/html files, and a pager on all other
       text formats, then you would use the following:

            text/html; lynx %s
            text/*; more

       This is the simplest form of a mailcap file.

       _5_._3_._2  _S_e_c_u_r_e _u_s_e _o_f _m_a_i_l_c_a_p

       The interpretation of shell meta-characters embedded in MIME parameters can
       lead to security problems in general.  Mutt-ng tries to quote parameters in
       expansion of %s syntaxes properly, and avoids risky characters by substituting
       them, see the _m_a_i_l_c_a_p___s_a_n_i_t_i_z_e (section 6.3.117  , page 94) variable.

       Although mutt's procedures to invoke programs with mailcap seem to be safe,
       there are other applications parsing mailcap, maybe taking less care of it.
       Therefore you should pay attention to the following rules:

       _K_e_e_p _t_h_e _%_-_e_x_p_a_n_d_o_s _a_w_a_y _f_r_o_m _s_h_e_l_l _q_u_o_t_i_n_g_.  Don't quote them with single or
       double quotes.  Mutt-ng does this for you, the right way, as should any other
       program which interprets mailcap.  Don't put them into backtick expansions.  Be
       highly careful with eval statements, and avoid them if possible at all.  Trying
       to fix broken behaviour with quotes introduces new leaks - there is no alterna-
       tive to correct quoting in the first place.

       If you have to use the %-expandos' values in context where you need quoting or
       backtick expansions, put that value into a shell variable and reference the
       shell variable where necessary, as in the following example (using $charset
       inside the backtick expansion is safe, since it is not itself subject to any
       further expansion):

            text/test-mailcap-bug; cat %s; copiousoutput; test=charset=%{charset} \
                    && test "`echo $charset | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`" != iso-8859-1

       _5_._3_._3  _A_d_v_a_n_c_e_d _m_a_i_l_c_a_p _U_s_a_g_e

       _5_._3_._3_._1  _O_p_t_i_o_n_a_l _F_i_e_l_d_s

       In addition to the required content-type and view command fields, you can add
       semi-colon ';' separated fields to set flags and other options.  Mutt-ng recog-
       nizes the following optional fields:

             copiousoutput
                   This flag tells Mutt-ng that the command passes possibly large
                   amounts of text on stdout.  This causes Mutt-ng to invoke a pager

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    58

                   (either the internal pager or the external pager defined by the
                   pager variable) on the output of the view command.  Without this
                   flag, Mutt-ng assumes that the command is interactive.  One could
                   use this to replace the pipe to more in the lynx -dump example in
                   the Basic section:

                        text/html; lynx -dump %s ; copiousoutput

                   This will cause lynx to format the text/html output as text/plain
                   and Mutt-ng will use your standard pager to display the results.

             needsterminal
                   Mutt-ng uses this flag when viewing attachments with _a_u_t_o_v_i_e_w (sec-
                   tion 5.4  , page 60), in order to decide whether it should honor
                   the setting of the _$_w_a_i_t___k_e_y (section 6.3.332  , page 145) variable
                   or not.  When an attachment is viewed using an interactive program,
                   and the corresponding mailcap entry has a _n_e_e_d_s_t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l flag, Mutt-
                   ng will use _$_w_a_i_t___k_e_y (section 6.3.332  , page 145) and the exit
                   status of the program to decide if it will ask you to press a key
                   after the external program has exited.  In all other situations it
                   will not prompt you for a key.

             compose=<command>
                   This flag specifies the command to use to create a new attachment
                   of a specific MIME type.  Mutt-ng supports this from the compose
                   menu.

             composetyped=<command>
                   This flag specifies the command to use to create a new attachment
                   of a specific MIME type.  This command differs from the compose
                   command in that mutt will expect standard MIME headers on the data.
                   This can be used to specify parameters, filename, description, etc.
                   for a new attachment.   Mutt-ng supports this from the compose
                   menu.

             print=<command>
                   This flag specifies the command to use to print a specific MIME
                   type.  Mutt-ng supports this from the attachment and compose menus.

             edit=<command>
                   This flag specifies the command to use to edit a specific MIME
                   type.  Mutt-ng supports this from the compose menu, and also uses
                   it to compose new attachments.  Mutt-ng will default to the defined
                   editor for text attachments.

             nametemplate=<template>
                   This field specifies the format for the file denoted by %s in the
                   command fields.  Certain programs will require a certain file
                   extension, for instance, to correctly view a file.  For instance,
                   lynx will only interpret a file as text/html if the file ends in
                   .html.  So, you would specify lynx as a text/html viewer with a
                   line in the mailcap file like:

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    59

                        text/html; lynx %s; nametemplate=%s.html

             test=<command>
                   This field specifies a command to run to test whether this mailcap
                   entry should be used.  The command is defined with the command
                   expansion rules defined in the next section.  If the command
                   returns 0, then the test passed, and Mutt-ng uses this entry.  If
                   the command returns non-zero, then the test failed, and Mutt-ng
                   continues searching for the right entry.  NNoottee:: _t_h_e _c_o_n_t_e_n_t_-_t_y_p_e
                   _m_u_s_t _m_a_t_c_h _b_e_f_o_r_e _M_u_t_t_-_n_g _p_e_r_f_o_r_m_s _t_h_e _t_e_s_t_.  For example:

                        text/html; netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)' ; test=RunningX
                        text/html; lynx %s

                   In this example, Mutt-ng will run the program RunningX which will
                   return 0 if the X Window manager is running, and non-zero if it
                   isn't.  If RunningX returns 0, then Mutt-ng will call netscape to
                   display the text/html object.  If RunningX doesn't return 0, then
                   Mutt-ng will go on to the next entry and use lynx to display the
                   text/html object.

       _5_._3_._3_._2  _S_e_a_r_c_h _O_r_d_e_r

       When searching for an entry in the mailcap file, Mutt-ng will search for the
       most useful entry for its purpose.  For instance, if you are attempting to
       print an image/gif, and you have the following entries in your mailcap file,
       Mutt-ng will search for an entry with the print command:

            image/*;        xv %s
            image/gif;      ; print= anytopnm %s | pnmtops | lpr; \
                            nametemplate=%s.gif

       Mutt-ng will skip the image/* entry and use the image/gif entry with the print
       command.

       In addition, you can use this with _A_u_t_o_v_i_e_w (section 5.4  , page 60) to denote
       two commands for viewing an attachment, one to be viewed automatically, the
       other to be viewed interactively from the attachment menu.  In addition, you
       can then use the test feature to determine which viewer to use interactively
       depending on your environment.

            text/html;      netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)' ; test=RunningX
            text/html;      lynx %s; nametemplate=%s.html
            text/html;      lynx -dump %s; nametemplate=%s.html; copiousoutput

       For _A_u_t_o_v_i_e_w (section 5.4  , page 60), Mutt-ng will choose the third entry
       because of the copiousoutput tag.  For interactive viewing, Mutt will run the
       program RunningX to determine if it should use the first entry.  If the program
       returns non-zero, Mutt-ng will use the second entry for interactive viewing.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    60

       The various commands defined in the mailcap files are passed to the /bin/sh
       shell using the system() function.  Before the command is passed to /bin/sh -c,
       it is parsed to expand various special parameters with information from Mutt-
       ng.  The keywords Mutt-ng expands are:

             %s
                   As seen in the basic mailcap section, this variable is expanded to
                   a filename specified by the calling program.  This file contains
                   the body of the message to view/print/edit or where the composing
                   program should place the results of composition.  In addition, the
                   use of this keyword causes Mutt-ng to not pass the body of the mes-
                   sage to the view/print/edit program on stdin.

             %t
                   Mutt-ng will expand %t to the text representation of the content
                   type of the message in the same form as the first parameter of the
                   mailcap definition line, ie text/html or image/gif.

             %{<parameter>}
                   Mutt-ng will expand this to the value of the specified parameter
                   from the Content-Type: line of the mail message.  For instance, if
                   Your mail message contains:

                        Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1

                   then Mutt-ng will expand %{charset} to iso-8859-1.  The default
                   metamail mailcap file uses this feature to test the charset to
                   spawn an xterm using the right charset to view the message.

             \%
                   This will be replaced by a %

       Mutt-ng does not currently support the %F and %n keywords specified in RFC
       1524.  The main purpose of these parameters is for multipart messages, which is
       handled internally by Mutt-ng.

       This mailcap file is fairly simple and standard:

            # I'm always running X :)
            video/*;        xanim %s > /dev/null
            image/*;        xv %s > /dev/null

            # I'm always running netscape (if my computer had more memory, maybe)
            text/html;      netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)'

       This mailcap file shows quite a number of examples:

       In addition to explicitly telling Mutt-ng to view an attachment with the MIME
       viewer defined in the mailcap file, Mutt-ng has support for automatically view-
       ing MIME attachments while in the pager.

       To work, you must define a viewer in the mailcap file which uses the copi-
       ousoutput option to denote that it is non-interactive.  Usually, you also use
       the entry to convert the attachment to a text representation which you can view
       in the pager.

       You then use the auto_view muttrc command to list the content-types that you
       wish to view automatically.

       For instance, if you set auto_view to:

            auto_view text/html application/x-gunzip application/postscript image/gif application/x-tar-gz

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    62

       Mutt-ng could use the following mailcap entries to automatically view attach-
       ments of these types.

            text/html;      lynx -dump %s; copiousoutput; nametemplate=%s.html
            image/*;        anytopnm %s | pnmscale -xsize 80 -ysize 50 | ppmtopgm | pgmtopbm | pbmtoascii ; copiousoutput
            application/x-gunzip;   gzcat; copiousoutput
            application/x-tar-gz; gunzip -c %s | tar -tf - ; copiousoutput
            application/postscript; ps2ascii %s; copiousoutput

       ``unauto_view'' can be used to remove previous entries from the autoview list.
       This can be used with message-hook to autoview messages based on size, etc.
       ``unauto_view *'' will remove all previous entries.

       Mutt-ng has some heuristics for determining which attachment of a multi-
       part/alternative type to display.  First, mutt will check the alternative_order
       list to determine if one of the available types is preferred.  The alterna-
       tive_order list consists of a number of MIME types in order, including support
       for implicit and explicit wildcards, for example:

            alternative_order text/enriched text/plain text application/postscript image/*

       Next, mutt will check if any of the types have a defined _a_u_t_o___v_i_e_w (section
       5.4  , page 60), and use that.  Failing that, Mutt-ng will look for any text
       type.  As a last attempt, mutt will look for any type it knows how to handle.

       To remove a MIME type from the alternative_order list, use the unalterna-
       tive_order command.

       Mutt-ng's mime_lookup list specifies a list of mime-types that should not be
       treated according to their mailcap entry.  This option is designed to deal with
       binary types such as application/octet-stream.  When an attachment's mime-type
       is listed in mime_lookup, then the extension of the filename will be compared
       to the list of extensions in the mime.types file.  The mime-type associated
       with this extension will then be used to process the attachment according to
       the rules in the mailcap file and according to any other configuration options
       (such as auto_view) specified.  Common usage would be:

            mime_lookup application/octet-stream application/X-Lotus-Manuscript

       In addition, the unmime_lookup command may be used to disable this feature for
       any particular mime-type if it had been set, for example, in a global muttrc.

       Running mutt with no arguments will make Mutt-ng attempt to read your spool
       mailbox.  However, it is possible to read other mailboxes and to send messages
       from the command line as well.

            -A   expand an alias
            -a      attach a file to a message
            -b      specify a blind carbon-copy (BCC) address
            -c      specify a carbon-copy (Cc) address
            -D      print the value of all variables on stdout
            -e      specify a config command to be run after initialization files are read
            -f      specify a mailbox to load
            -F      specify an alternate file to read initialization commands
            -h      print help on command line options
            -H      specify a draft file from which to read a header and body
            -i      specify a file to include in a message composition
            -m      specify a default mailbox type
            -n      do not read the system Muttngrc
            -p      recall a postponed message
            -Q      query a configuration variable
            -R      open mailbox in read-only mode
            -s      specify a subject (enclose in quotes if it contains spaces)
            -v      show version number and compile-time definitions
            -x      simulate the mailx(1) compose mode
            -y      show a menu containing the files specified by the mailboxes command
            -z      exit immediately if there are no messages in the mailbox
            -Z      open the first folder with new message,exit immediately if none

       To read messages in a mailbox

       mutt [ -nz ] [ -F _m_u_t_t_r_c ] [ -m _t_y_p_e ] [ -f _m_a_i_l_b_o_x ]

       To compose a new message

       mutt [ -n ] [ -F _m_u_t_t_r_c ] [ -a _f_i_l_e ] [ -c _a_d_d_r_e_s_s ] [ -i _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e ] [ -s _s_u_b_-

       Mutt-ng also supports a ``batch'' mode to send prepared messages.  Simply redi-
       rect input from the file you wish to send.  For example,

       mutt -s 'data set for run #2' professor@bigschool.edu < ~/run2.dat

       This command will send a message to ``professor@bigschool.edu'' with a subject
       of ``data set for run #2''.  In the body of the message will be the contents of
       the file ``~/run2.dat''.

       prompt, composition will be aborted.  If set to _n_o, composing messages with no
       subject given at the subject prompt will never be aborted.

       Type: quadoption

       Default: yes

       If set to _y_e_s, composition will automatically abort after editing the message
       body if no changes are made to the file (this check only happens after the
       _f_i_r_s_t edit of the file).  When set to _n_o, composition will never be aborted.

       Type: path

       Default: '~/.muttngrc'

       The default file in which to save aliases created by the ``_c_r_e_a_t_e_-_a_l_i_a_s (sec-
       tion 2.3.4  , page 7)'' function.

       NNoottee:: Mutt-ng will not automatically source this file; you must explicitly use
       the ``_s_o_u_r_c_e (section 3.26  , page 32)'' command for it to be executed.

       _6_._3_._4  _a_l_i_a_s___f_o_r_m_a_t

       Type: string

       Default: '%4n %2f %t %-10a   %r'

       Specifies the format of the data displayed for the ``alias'' menu. The follow-
       ing printf(3)-style sequences are available:

             %a
                   alias name

             %f
                   flags - currently, a 'd' for an alias marked for deletion

                   character which indicates if the alias is tagged for inclusion

       _6_._3_._5  _a_l_l_o_w___8_b_i_t

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       Controls whether 8-bit data is converted to 7-bit using either quoted-printable
       or base64 encoding when sending mail.

       _6_._3_._6  _a_l_l_o_w___a_n_s_i

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       Controls whether ANSI color codes in messages (and color tags in rich text mes-
       sages) are to be interpreted.  Messages containing these codes are rare, but if
       this option is set, their text will be colored accordingly. Note that this may
       override your color choices, and even present a security problem, since a mes-
       sage could include a line like ``[-- PGP output follows ...' and give it the
       same color as your attachment color.

       _6_._3_._7  _a_r_r_o_w___c_u_r_s_o_r

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       When _s_e_t, an arrow (``->'') will be used to indicate the current entry in menus
       instead of highlighting the whole line.  On slow network or modem links this
       will make response faster because there is less that has to be redrawn on the
       screen when moving to the next or previous entries in the menu.

       _6_._3_._8  _a_s_c_i_i___c_h_a_r_s

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       If _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will use plain ASCII characters when displaying thread and
       attachment trees, instead of the default ACS characters.

       _6_._3_._9  _a_s_k_b_c_c

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       editing an outgoing message.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    68

       _6_._3_._1_0  _a_s_k_c_c

       Type: boolean

       Type: string

       Default: 'us-ascii'

       This variable is a colon-separated list of character encoding schemes for mes-
       sages without character encoding indication.  Header field values and message
       body content without character encoding indication would be assumed that they
       are written in one of this list.  By default, all the header fields and message
       body without any charset indication are assumed to be in us-ascii.

       For example, Japanese users might prefer this:

       set assumed_charset='iso-2022-jp:euc-jp:shift_jis:utf-8'

       However, only the first content is valid for the message body.  This variable
       is valid only if _$_s_t_r_i_c_t___m_i_m_e (section 6.3.308  , page 140) is unset.

       Default: '%u%D%I %t%4n %T%.40d%> [%.7m/%.10M, %.6e%?C?, %C?, %s] '

       This variable describes the format of the ``attachment'' menu.  The following
       printf(3)-style sequences are understood:

             %C
                   charset

             %c
                   requires charset conversion (n or c)

             %D
                   deleted flag

       _6_._3_._1_3  _a_t_t_a_c_h___s_e_p

       Type: string

       Default: '\n'

       The separator to add between attachments when operating (saving, printing, pip-
       ing, etc) on a list of tagged attachments.

       _6_._3_._1_4  _a_t_t_a_c_h___s_p_l_i_t

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       If this variable is _u_n_s_e_t, when operating (saving, printing, piping, etc) on a
       list of tagged attachments, Mutt-ng will concatenate the attachments and will
       operate on them as a single attachment. The ``_$_a_t_t_a_c_h___s_e_p (section 6.3.13  ,
       page 68)'' separator is added after each attachment. When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will
       operate on the attachments one by one.

       _6_._3_._1_5  _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_i_o_n

       Default: 'On %d, %n wrote:'

       This is the string that will precede a message which has been included in a
       reply.  For a full listing of defined printf(3)-like sequences see the section
       on ``_$_i_n_d_e_x___f_o_r_m_a_t (section 6.3.110  , page 90)''.

       _6_._3_._1_6  _a_u_t_o___t_a_g

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       When _s_e_t, functions in the _i_n_d_e_x menu which affect a message will be applied to
       all tagged messages (if there are any).  When unset, you must first use the
       ``tag-prefix'' function (default: ';') to make the next function apply to all
       tagged messages.

       _6_._3_._1_7  _a_u_t_o_e_d_i_t

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       When _s_e_t along with ``_$_e_d_i_t___h_e_a_d_e_r_s (section 6.3.54  , page 77)'', Mutt-ng will
       skip the initial send-menu and allow you to immediately begin editing the body
       of your message.  The send-menu may still be accessed once you have finished
       editing the body of your message.

       Also see ``_$_f_a_s_t___r_e_p_l_y (section 6.3.60  , page 78)''.

       _6_._3_._1_8  _b_e_e_p

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       When this variable is _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will beep when an error occurs.

       _6_._3_._1_9  _b_e_e_p___n_e_w

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       When this variable is _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will beep whenever it prints a message noti-
       fying you of new mail.  This is independent of the setting of the ``_$_b_e_e_p (sec-
       tion 6.3.18  , page 69)'' variable.

       _6_._3_._2_0  _b_o_u_n_c_e

       Type: quadoption

       Default: ask-yes

       Controls whether you will be asked to confirm bouncing messages.  If set to _y_e_s
       you don't get asked if you want to bounce a message. Setting this variable to
       _n_o is not generally useful, and thus not recommended, because you are unable to
       bounce messages.

       _6_._3_._2_1  _b_o_u_n_c_e___d_e_l_i_v_e_r_e_d

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       When this variable is _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will include Delivered-To: header fields
       when bouncing messages.  Postfix users may wish to _u_n_s_e_t this variable.

       _6_._3_._2_2  _b_r_a_i_l_l_e___f_r_i_e_n_d_l_y

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       When this variable is set, mutt will place the cursor at the beginning of the
       current line in menus, even when the arrow_cursor variable is unset, making it
       easier for blind persons using Braille displays to follow these menus.  The
       option is disabled by default because many visual terminals don't permit making
       the cursor invisible.

       Type: path

       Default: '~/.mutt_certificates'

       Availability: SSL or NSS or GNUTLS

       This variable specifies the file where the certificates you trust are saved.
       When an unknown certificate is encountered, you are asked if you accept it or
       not. If you accept it, the certificate can also be saved in this file and fur-
       ther connections are automatically accepted.

       You can also manually add CA certificates in this file. Any server certificate
       that is signed with one of these CA certificates are also automatically
       accepted.

       Example: set certificate_file=~/.muttng/certificates

       _6_._3_._2_4  _c_h_a_r_s_e_t

       NNoottee:: this option only affects _m_a_i_l_d_i_r and _M_H style mailboxes.

       When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will check for new mail delivered while the mailbox is open.
       Especially with MH mailboxes, this operation can take quite some time since it
       involves scanning the directory and checking each file to see if it has already
       been looked at.  If it's _u_n_s_e_t, no check for new mail is performed while the
       mailbox is open.

       Controls the format of the status line displayed in the ``compose'' menu.  This
       string is similar to ``_$_s_t_a_t_u_s___f_o_r_m_a_t (section 6.3.305  , page 138)'', but has
       its own set of printf(3)-like sequences:

       Type: number

       Default: 30

       Causes Mutt-ng to timeout a network connection (for IMAP or POP) after this
       many seconds if the connection is not able to be established.  A negative value
       causes Mutt-ng to wait indefinitely for the connection to succeed.

       This variable controls whether or not copies of your outgoing messages will be
       saved for later references.  Also see ``_$_r_e_c_o_r_d (section 6.3.230  , page

       Default: no

       Setting this variable will cause Mutt-ng to always attempt to PGP encrypt out-
       going messages.  This is probably only useful in connection to the _s_e_n_d_-_h_o_o_k
       command.  It can be overridden by use of the _p_g_p_-_m_e_n_u, when encryption is not
       required or signing is requested as well.  If ``_$_s_m_i_m_e___i_s___d_e_f_a_u_l_t (section

       This variable controls how send-hooks, message-hooks, save-hooks, and fcc-hooks
       will be interpreted if they are specified with only a simple regexp, instead of
       a matching pattern.  The hooks are expanded when they are declared, so a hook
       will be interpreted according to the value of this variable at the time the
       hook is declared.  The default value matches if the message is either from a
       user matching the regular expression given, or if it is from you (if the from
       address matches ``alternates'') and is to or cc'ed to a user matching the given

       which you are not subscribed.  The header will contain only the list's address
       for subscribed lists, and both the list address and your own email address for
       unsubscribed lists.  Without this header, a group reply to your message sent to
       a subscribed list will be sent to both the list and your address, resulting in
       two copies of the same email for you.

       Type: e-mail address

       Default: ''

       This variable contains a default from address.  It can be overridden using
       my_hdr (including from send-hooks) and ``_$_r_e_v_e_r_s_e___n_a_m_e (section 6.3.236  , page

       144)'' is unset.

       E.g. you can use send-hook Mutt-ng-devel@lists.berlios.de 'my_hdr From: Foo Bar
       <foo@bar.fb>' when replying to the mutt-ng developer's mailing list and Mutt-ng
       takes this email address.

       Defaults to the contents of the environment variable $EMAIL.

       Type: regular expression

       Default: '^[^,]*'

       A regular expression used by Mutt-ng to parse the GECOS field of a password
       entry when expanding the alias.  By default the regular expression is set to
       ``^[^,]*'' which will return the string up to the first ``,'' encountered.  If
       the GECOS field contains a string like 'lastname, firstname' then you should
       do: set gecos_mask='.*'.

       This can be useful if you see the following behavior: you address a e-mail to
       user ID stevef whose full name is Steve Franklin.  If Mutt-ng expands stevef to
       ``Franklin'' stevef@foo.bar then you should set the gecos_mask to a regular
       expression that will match the whole name so Mutt-ng will expand ``Franklin''
       to ``Franklin, Steve''.

       Default: no

       When _s_e_t, this variable causes Mutt-ng to include the header of the message you
       are replying to into the edit buffer.  The ``_$_w_e_e_d (section 6.3.333  , page

       page 83) points to a file that file will be a single global header cache. By
       default it is _u_n_s_e_t so no header caching will be used.

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       If enabled the header cache will be compressed. So only one fifth of the usual

       Type: number

       Default: 300

       This variable configures how often (in seconds) Mutt-ng should look for new
       mail in IMAP folders. This is split from the ``_m_a_i_l___c_h_e_c_k (section 6.3.115  ,
       page 93)'' variable to generate less traffic and get more accurate information
       for local folders.

       _6_._3_._1_0_0  _i_m_a_p___p_a_s_s

       Type: string

       Default: ''

       Availability: IMAP

       Specifies the password for your IMAP account.  If _u_n_s_e_t, Mutt-ng will prompt
       you for your password when you invoke the fetch-mail function.

       WWaarrnniinngg: you should only use this option when you are on a fairly secure
       machine, because the superuser can read your configuration even if you are the
       only one who can read the file.

       _6_._3_._1_0_1  _i_m_a_p___p_a_s_s_i_v_e

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       Availability: IMAP

       When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will not open new IMAP connections to check for new mail.
       Mutt-ng will only check for new mail over existing IMAP connections.  This is
       useful if you don't want to be prompted to user/password pairs on Mutt-ng invo-
       cation, or if opening the connection is slow.

       _6_._3_._1_0_2  _i_m_a_p___p_e_e_k

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       Availability: IMAP

       If _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will avoid implicitly marking your mail as read whenever you
       fetch a message from the server. This is generally a good thing, but can make
       closing an IMAP folder somewhat slower. This option exists to appease speed
       freaks.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    90

       Type: quadoption

       Default: ask-yes

       Availability: IMAP

       Controls whether or not Mutt-ng will try to reconnect to IMAP server when the
       connection is lost.

       _6_._3_._1_0_4  _i_m_a_p___s_e_r_v_e_r_n_o_i_s_e

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       Availability: IMAP

       When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will display warning messages from the IMAP server as error
       messages. Since these messages are often harmless, or generated due to configu-
       ration problems on the server which are out of the users' hands, you may wish
       to suppress them at some point.

       _6_._3_._1_0_5  _i_m_a_p___u_s_e_r

       Type: string

       Default: ''

       Availability: IMAP

       The name of the user whose mail you intend to access on the IMAP server.

       This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.

       _6_._3_._1_0_6  _i_m_p_l_i_c_i_t___a_u_t_o_v_i_e_w

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       If _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will look for a mailcap entry with the ``copiousoutput'' flag
       set for _e_v_e_r_y MIME attachment it doesn't have an internal viewer defined for.
       If such an entry is found, Mutt-ng will use the viewer defined in that entry to
       convert the body part to text form.

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       Controls whether or not Mutt-ng includes only the first attachment of the mes-
       sage you are replying.

       Type: string

       Default: '> '

       Specifies the string to prepend to each line of text quoted in a message to
       which you are replying.  You are strongly encouraged not to change this value,
       as it tends to agitate the more fanatical netizens.

       _6_._3_._1_1_0  _i_n_d_e_x___f_o_r_m_a_t

       Type: string

       Default: '%4C %Z %{%b %d} %-15.15L (%?l?%4l&%4c?) %s'

       This variable allows you to customize the message index display to your per-
       sonal taste.

       ``Format strings'' are similar to the strings used in the ``C'' function
       printf(3) to format output (see the man page for more detail).  The following
       sequences are defined in Mutt-ng:

             %a
                   address of the author

             %A
                   reply-to address (if present; otherwise: address of author)

             %l
                   number of lines in the message (does not work with maildir, mh, and
                   possibly IMAP folders)

             %L
                   If an address in the To or CC header field matches an address
                   defined by the users ``subscribe'' command, this displays 'To

       Default: no

       When _s_e_t, address replies to the mailing list the original message came from
       (instead to the author only). Setting this option to ``_a_s_k_-_y_e_s'' or ``_a_s_k_-_n_o''
       will ask if you really intended to reply to the author only.

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       If _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will restrict possible characters in mailcap % expandos to a
       well-defined set of safe characters.  This is the safe setting, but we are not
       sure it doesn't break some more advanced MIME stuff.

       Availability: Header Cache

       Check for Maildir unaware programs other than Mutt-ng having modified maildir
       files when the header cache is in use. This incurs one stat(2) per message
       every time the folder is opened.

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       If _s_e_t, messages marked as deleted will be saved with the maildir (T)rashed
       flag instead of physically deleted.

       NNOOTTEE:: this only applies to maildir-style mailboxes. Setting it will have no

       Default: yes

       Controls whether or not Mutt-ng marks _n_e_w uunnrreeaadd messages as _o_l_d if you exit a
       mailbox without reading them.

       With this option _s_e_t, the next time you start Mutt-ng, the messages will show
       up with an 'O' next to them in the ``index'' menu, indicating that they are
       old.

       _6_._3_._1_2_1  _m_a_r_k_e_r_s

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       Controls the display of wrapped lines in the internal pager. If set, a ``+''
       marker is displayed at the beginning of wrapped lines. Also see the
       ``_$_s_m_a_r_t___w_r_a_p (section 6.3.263  , page 128)'' variable.

       Type: regular expression

       Default: '!^\.[^.]'

       A regular expression used in the file browser, optionally preceded by the _n_o_t
       operator ``!''.  Only files whose names match this mask will be shown. The
       match is always case-sensitive.

       Type: number

       Default: 0

       When _s_e_t, the maximum line length for displaying ``format = flowed'' messages
       is limited to this length. A value of 0 (which is also the default) means that
       the maximum line length is determined by the terminal width and _$_w_r_a_p_m_a_r_g_i_n
       (section 6.3.335  , page 146).

       When _s_e_t, menus will be scrolled up or down one line when you attempt to move
       across a screen boundary.  If _u_n_s_e_t, the screen is cleared and the next or pre-

       If _s_e_t, forces Mutt-ng to interpret keystrokes with the high bit (bit 8) set as
       if the user had pressed the ESC key and whatever key remains after having the
       high bit removed.  For example, if the key pressed has an ASCII value of 0xf4,
       then this is treated as if the user had pressed ESC then ``x''.  This is

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                    98

       because the result of removing the high bit from ``0xf4'' is ``0x74'', which is
       the ASCII character ``x''.

       Type: path

       Default: 'builtin'

       This variable specifies which pager you would like to use to view messages.
       ``builtin'' means to use the builtin pager, otherwise this variable should
       specify the pathname of the external pager you would like to use.

       Using an external pager may have some disadvantages: Additional keystrokes are
       necessary because you can't call Mutt-ng functions directly from the pager, and
       screen resizes cause lines longer than the screen width to be badly formatted
       in the help menu.

       Type: number

       Default: 0

       This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given when dis-
       playing the next or previous page in the internal pager.  By default, Mutt-ng
       will display the line after the last one on the screen at the top of the next

       This variable controls the format of the one-line message ``status'' displayed
       before each message in either the internal or an external pager.  The valid
       sequences are listed in the ``_$_i_n_d_e_x___f_o_r_m_a_t (section 6.3.110  , page 90)'' sec-

       Type: number

       Default: 0

       Determines the number of lines of a mini-index which is shown when in the
       pager.  The current message, unless near the top or bottom of the folder, will
       be roughly one third of the way down this mini-index, giving the reader the
       context of a few messages before and after the message.  This is useful, for
       example, to determine how many messages remain to be read in the current
       thread.  One of the lines is reserved for the status bar from the index, so a
       _p_a_g_e_r___i_n_d_e_x___l_i_n_e_s of 6 will only show 5 lines of the actual index.  A value of
       0 results in no index being shown.  If the number of messages in the current
       folder is less than _p_a_g_e_r___i_n_d_e_x___l_i_n_e_s, then the index will only use as many

       Default: no

       If _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will automatically attempt to decrypt traditional PGP messages
       whenever the user performs an operation which ordinarily would result in the
       contents of the message being operated on.  For example, if the user displays a
       pgp-traditional message which has not been manually checked with the check-tra-
       ditional-pgp function, Mutt-ng will automatically check the message for tradi-
       tional pgp.

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       This option controls whether Mutt-ng generates old-style inline (traditional)
       PGP encrypted or signed messages under certain circumstances.  This can be
       overridden by use of the _p_g_p_-_m_e_n_u, when inline is not required.

       Note that Mutt-ng might automatically use PGP/MIME for messages which consist
       of more than a single MIME part.  Mutt-ng can be configured to ask before send-
       ing PGP/MIME messages when inline (traditional) would not work.  See also:

       Default: ''

       This format strings specifies a command which is used to decode application/pgp
       attachments.

       The PGP command formats have their own set of printf(3)-like sequences:

             %p
                   Expands to PGPPASSFD=0 when a pass phrase is needed, to an empty
                   string otherwise. Note: This may be used with a %? construct.

             %f
                   Expands to the name of a file containing a message.

             %s
                   Expands to the name of a file containing the signature part of a
                   multipart/signed attachment when verifying it.

             %a
                   The value of _$_p_g_p___s_i_g_n___a_s (section 6.3.192  , page 112).

             %r

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       Setting this variable will cause Mutt-ng to always attempt to create an inline
       (traditional) message when replying to a message which is PGP encrypted/signed
       inline.  This can be overridden by use of the _p_g_p_-_m_e_n_u, when inline is not
       required.  This option does not automatically detect if the (replied-to) mes-
       sage is inline; instead it relies on Mutt-ng internals for previously
       checked/flagged messages.

       Note that Mutt-ng might automatically use PGP/MIME for messages which consist

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       If _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will automatically encode PGP/MIME signed messages as quoted-
       printable.  Please note that unsetting this variable may lead to problems with
       non-verifyable PGP signatures, so only change this if you know what you are

       Default: no

       Used in connection with the _p_i_p_e_-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e command.  When _u_n_s_e_t, Mutt-ng will
       pipe the messages without any preprocessing. When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will weed head-
       ers and will attempt to PGP/MIME decode the messages first.

       _6_._3_._2_0_1  _p_i_p_e___s_e_p

       Type: string

       Used in connection with the _p_i_p_e_-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e command and the ``tag- prefix'' or
       ``tag-prefix-cond'' operators.  If this variable is _u_n_s_e_t, when piping a list
       of tagged messages Mutt-ng will concatenate the messages and will pipe them as
       a single folder.  When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will pipe the messages one by one.  In both
       cases the messages are piped in the current sorted order, and the ``_$_p_i_p_e___s_e_p
       (section 6.3.201  , page 114)'' separator is added after each message.

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       Availability: POP

       If _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will try all available methods. When _u_n_s_e_t, Mutt-ng will only
       fall back to other authentication methods if the previous methods are unavail-
       able. If a method is available but authentication fails, Mutt-ng will not con-
       nect to the POP server.

       Availability: POP

       This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods Mutt-ng may attempt to
       use to log in to an POP server, in the order Mutt-ng should try them.  Authen-
       tication methods are either ``user'', ``apop'' or any SASL mechanism, eg
       ``digest-md5'', ``gssapi'' or ``cram-md5''.

       This parameter is case-insensitive. If this parameter is _u_n_s_e_t (the default)
       Mutt-ng will try all available methods, in order from most-secure to least-
       secure.

       Availability: POP

       If _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will delete successfully downloaded messages from the POP
       server when using the ``fetch-mail'' function.  When _u_n_s_e_t, Mutt-ng will down-
       load messages but also leave them on the POP server.

       Default: ''

       If _s_e_t, a shell command to be executed if Mutt-ng fails to establish a connec-
       tion to the server. This is useful for setting up secure connections, e.g. with
       ssh(1). If the command returns a  nonzero status, Mutt-ng gives up opening the
       server. Example:

       preconnect='ssh -f -q -L 1234:mailhost.net:143 mailhost.net sleep 20 <
       /dev/null > /dev/null'

       Mailbox ``foo'' on mailhost.net can now be reached as ``{localhost:1234}foo''.

       The value of _$_r_e_c_o_r_d _(_s_e_c_t_i_o_n _6_._3_._2_3_0  _, _p_a_g_e _1_2_0_) is overridden by the
       ``_$_f_o_r_c_e___n_a_m_e (section 6.3.68  , page 81)'' and ``_$_s_a_v_e___n_a_m_e (section
       6.3.241  , page 123)'' variables, and the ``_f_c_c_-_h_o_o_k (section 3.16  , page
       27)'' command.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                   122

       _6_._3_._2_3_1  _r_e_p_l_y___r_e_g_e_x_p

       Type: regular expression

       Default: '^(re([\[0-9\]+])*|aw):[ \t]*'

       A regular expression used to recognize reply messages when threading and reply-
       ing. The default value corresponds to the English ``Re:'' and the German
       ``Aw:''.

       _6_._3_._2_3_2  _r_e_p_l_y___s_e_l_f

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       If _u_n_s_e_t and you are replying to a message sent by you, Mutt-ng will assume
       that you want to reply to the recipients of that message rather than to your-
       self.

       _6_._3_._2_3_3  _r_e_p_l_y___t_o

       Type: quadoption

       Default: ask-yes

       If _s_e_t, when replying to a message, Mutt-ng will use the address listed in the
       ``Reply-To:'' header field as the recipient of the reply.  If _u_n_s_e_t, it will
       use the address in the ``From:'' header field instead.

       This option is useful for reading a mailing list that sets the ``Reply-To:''
       header field to the list address and you want to send a private message to the
       author of a message.

       _6_._3_._2_3_4  _r_e_s_o_l_v_e

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       When set, the cursor will be automatically advanced to the next (possibly
       undeleted) message whenever a command that modifies the current message is exe-
       cuted.

       _6_._3_._2_3_5  _r_e_v_e_r_s_e___a_l_i_a_s

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       This variable controls whether or not Mutt-ng will display the ``personal''
       name from your aliases in the index menu if it finds an alias that matches the
       message's sender.  For example, if you have the following alias:

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                   123

       alias juser abd30425@somewhere.net (Joe User)

       and then you receive mail which contains the following header:

       From: abd30425@somewhere.net

       It would be displayed in the index menu as ``Joe User'' instead of
       ``abd30425@somewhere.net.''  This is useful when the person's e-mail address is
       not human friendly (like CompuServe addresses).

       _6_._3_._2_3_6  _r_e_v_e_r_s_e___n_a_m_e

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       It may sometimes arrive that you receive mail to a certain machine, move the
       messages to another machine, and reply to some the messages from there.  If
       this variable is _s_e_t, the default From: line of the reply messages is built
       using the address where you received the messages you are replying to iiff that
       address matches your alternates.  If the variable is _u_n_s_e_t, or the address that
       would be used doesn't match your alternates, the From: line will use your
       address on the current machine.

       _6_._3_._2_3_7  _r_e_v_e_r_s_e___r_e_a_l_n_a_m_e

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       This variable fine-tunes the behaviour of the _r_e_v_e_r_s_e___n_a_m_e (section 6.3.236  ,
       page 122) feature.  When it is _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will use the address from incoming
       messages as-is, possibly including eventual real names.  When it is _u_n_s_e_t,
       Mutt-ng will override any such real names with the setting of the _r_e_a_l_n_a_m_e
       (section 6.3.228  , page 120) variable.

       _6_._3_._2_3_8  _r_f_c_2_0_4_7___p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       When this variable is _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will decode RFC-2047-encoded MIME parame-
       ters. You want to set this variable when Mutt-ng suggests you to save attach-
       ments to files named like this:

       =?iso-8859-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=

       When this variable is _s_e_t interactively, the change doesn't have the desired
       effect before you have changed folders.

       Note that this use of RFC 2047's encoding is explicitly, prohibited by the
       standard, but nevertheless encountered in the wild.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                   124

       Also note that setting this parameter will _n_o_t have the effect that Mutt-ng
       _g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e_s this kind of encoding.  Instead, Mutt-ng will unconditionally use the
       encoding specified in RFC 2231.

       _6_._3_._2_3_9  _s_a_v_e___a_d_d_r_e_s_s

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       If _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will take the sender's full address when choosing a default
       folder for saving a mail. If ``_$_s_a_v_e___n_a_m_e (section 6.3.241  , page 123)'' or
       ``_$_f_o_r_c_e___n_a_m_e (section 6.3.68  , page 81)'' is _s_e_t too, the selection of the
       fcc folder will be changed as well.

       _6_._3_._2_4_0  _s_a_v_e___e_m_p_t_y

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       When _u_n_s_e_t, mailboxes which contain no saved messages will be removed when
       closed (the exception is ``_$_s_p_o_o_l_f_i_l_e (section 6.3.295  , page 136)'' which is
       never removed).  If _s_e_t, mailboxes are never removed.

       NNoottee:: This only applies to mbox and MMDF folders, Mutt-ng does not delete MH
       and Maildir directories.

       _6_._3_._2_4_1  _s_a_v_e___n_a_m_e

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       This variable controls how copies of outgoing messages are saved.  When set, a
       check is made to see if a mailbox specified by the recipient address exists
       (this is done by searching for a mailbox in the ``_$_f_o_l_d_e_r (section 6.3.64  ,
       page 79)'' directory with the _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e part of the recipient address).  If the
       mailbox exists, the outgoing message will be saved to that mailbox, otherwise
       the message is saved to the ``_$_r_e_c_o_r_d (section 6.3.230  , page 120)'' mailbox.

       Also see the ``_$_f_o_r_c_e___n_a_m_e (section 6.3.68  , page 81)'' variable.

       _6_._3_._2_4_2  _s_c_o_r_e

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       When this variable is _u_n_s_e_t, scoring is turned off.  This can be useful to
       selectively disable scoring for certain folders when the ``_$_s_c_o_r_e___t_h_r_e_s_h_-
       _o_l_d___d_e_l_e_t_e (section 6.3.243  , page 123)'' variable and friends are used.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                   125

       Type: number

       Default: -1

       Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value of
       this variable are automatically marked for deletion by Mutt-ng.  Since Mutt-ng
       scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting of this
       variable will never mark a message for deletion.

       _6_._3_._2_4_4  _s_c_o_r_e___t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d___f_l_a_g

       Type: number

       Default: 9999

       Messages which have been assigned a score greater than or equal to this vari-
       able's value are automatically marked ``flagged''.

       _6_._3_._2_4_5  _s_c_o_r_e___t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d___r_e_a_d

       Type: number

       Default: -1

       Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value of
       this variable are automatically marked as read by Mutt-ng.  Since Mutt-ng
       scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting of this
       variable will never mark a message read.

       _6_._3_._2_4_6  _s_e_n_d___c_h_a_r_s_e_t

       Type: string

       Default: 'us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8'

       A list of character sets for outgoing messages. Mutt-ng will use the first
       character set into which the text can be converted exactly.  If your ``_$_c_h_a_r_s_e_t
       (section 6.3.24  , page 70)'' is not iso-8859-1 and recipients may not under-
       stand UTF-8, it is advisable to include in the list an appropriate widely used
       standard character set (such as iso-8859-2, koi8-r or iso-2022-jp) either
       instead of or after iso-8859-1.

       _6_._3_._2_4_7  _s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l

       Type: path

       Default: '/usr/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi'

       Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by Mutt-ng.
       Mutt-ng expects that the specified program interprets additional arguments as
       recipient addresses.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                   126

       Type: number

       Default: 0

       Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the ``_$_s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l (section 6.3.247  ,
       page 124)'' process to finish before giving up and putting delivery in the
       background.

       Mutt-ng interprets the value of this variable as follows:

             >0
                   number of seconds to wait for sendmail to finish before continuing

             0
                   wait forever for sendmail to finish

             <0
                   always put sendmail in the background without waiting

       Note that if you specify a value other than 0, the output of the child process
       will be put in a temporary file.  If there is some error, you will be informed
       as to where to find the output.

       _6_._3_._2_4_9  _s_h_e_l_l

       Type: path

       Default: ''

       Command to use when spawning a subshell.  By default, the user's login shell
       from /etc/passwd is used.

       _6_._3_._2_5_0  _s_i_d_e_b_a_r___b_o_u_n_d_a_r_y

       Type: string

       Default: '.'

       When the sidebar is displayed and _$_s_i_d_e_b_a_r___s_h_o_r_t_e_n___h_i_e_r_a_r_c_h_y (section
       6.3.254  , page 126) is _s_e_t, this variable specifies the characters at which to
       split a folder name into ``hierarchy items.''

       _6_._3_._2_5_1  _s_i_d_e_b_a_r___d_e_l_i_m

       Type: string

       Default: '|'

       This specifies the delimiter between the sidebar (if visible) and other
       screens.

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                   127

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       If _s_e_t, only folders with new mail will be shown in the sidebar.

       _6_._3_._2_5_3  _s_i_d_e_b_a_r___n_u_m_b_e_r___f_o_r_m_a_t

       Type: string

       Default: '%c%?n?(%n)?%?f?[%f]?'

       This variable controls how message counts are printed when the sidebar is
       enabled. If this variable is _e_m_p_t_y (_a_n_d _o_n_l_y _i_f), no numbers will be printed
       _a_n_d mutt-ng won't frequently count mail (which may be a great speedup esp. with
       mbox-style mailboxes.)

       The following printf(3)-like sequences are supported:

             %c
                   Total number of messages.

             %f
                   Number of flagged messages.

             %n
                   Number of new messages.

       The %f and %n expandos may optionally be printed non-zero.

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       When _s_e_t, the ``hierarchy'' of the sidebar entries will be shortened only if
       they cannot be printed in full length (because ``_$_s_i_d_e_b_a_r___w_i_d_t_h (section
       6.3.256  , page 126)'' is set to a too low value). For example, if the news-
       group name ``de.alt.sysadmin.recovery'' doesn't fit on the screen, it'll get
       shortened ``d.a.s.recovery'' while ``de.alt.d0'' still would and thus will not
       get shortened.

       At which characters this compression is done is controled via the _$_s_i_d_e_-
       _b_a_r___b_o_u_n_d_a_r_y (section 6.3.250  , page 125) variable.

       This specifies whether or not to show the sidebar (a list of folders specified
       with the ``mailboxes'' command).

       _6_._3_._2_5_6  _s_i_d_e_b_a_r___w_i_d_t_h

       Type: number

       Default: 0

       The width of the sidebar.

       _6_._3_._2_5_7  _s_i_g___d_a_s_h_e_s

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       If set, a line containing ``-- '' (dash, dash, space) will be inserted before
       your ``_$_s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e (section 6.3.259  , page 127)''.  It is ssttrroonnggllyy recommended
       that you not unset this variable unless your ``signature'' contains just your
       name. The reason for this is because many software packages use ``-- \n'' to
       detect your signature.

       For example, Mutt-ng has the ability to highlight the signature in a different
       color in the builtin pager.

       _6_._3_._2_5_8  _s_i_g___o_n___t_o_p

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       If _s_e_t, the signature will be included before any quoted or forwarded text.  It
       is ssttrroonnggllyy recommended that you do not set this variable unless you really
       know what you are doing, and are prepared to take some heat from netiquette
       guardians.

       _6_._3_._2_5_9  _s_i_g_n_a_t_u_r_e

       Type: path

       Default: '~/.signature'

       Specifies the filename of your signature, which is appended to all outgoing
       messages.   If the filename ends with a pipe (``|''), it is assumed that file-
       name is a shell command and input should be read from its stdout.

       Type: string

       Default: ''

       If _s_e_t, this string will be inserted before the signature. This is useful for

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                   129

       people that want to sign off every message they send with their name.

       If you want to insert your website's URL, additional contact information or
       witty quotes into your mails, better use a signature file instead of the sig-
       noff string.

       _6_._3_._2_6_1  _s_i_m_p_l_e___s_e_a_r_c_h

       Type: string

       Default: '~f %s | ~s %s'

       Specifies how Mutt-ng should expand a simple search into a real search pattern.
       A simple search is one that does not contain any of the ~ operators.  See

       For example, if you simply type ``joe'' at a search or limit prompt, Mutt-ng
       will automatically expand it to the value specified by this variable.  For the
       default value it would be:

       ~f joe | ~s joe

       Specifies time, in seconds, to pause while displaying certain informational
       messages, while moving from folder to folder and after expunging messages from
       the current folder.  The default is to pause one second, so a value of zero for
       this option suppresses the pause.

       Since there is no pubring/secring as with PGP, Mutt-ng has to handle storage
       and retrieval of keys by itself. This is very basic right now, and keys and
       certificates are stored in two different directories, both named as the hash-
       value retrieved from OpenSSL. There is an index file which contains mailbox-
       address keyid pairs, and which can be manually edited. This one points to the
       location of the certificates.  (S/MIME only)

       This format string specifies a command which is used to decrypt application/x-
       pkcs7-mime attachments.

       The OpenSSL command formats have their own set of printf(3)-like sequences sim-
       ilar to PGP's:

             %f
                   Expands to the name of a file containing a message.

             %s
                   Expands to the name of a file containing the signature part of a
                   multipart/signed attachment when verifying it.

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       If _s_e_t (default) this tells Mutt-ng to use the default key for decryption. Oth-
       erwise, if manage multiple certificate-key-pairs, Mutt-ng will try to use the
       mailbox-address to determine the key to use. It will ask you to supply a key,
       if it can't find one.  (S/MIME only)

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       The default behaviour of Mutt-ng is to use PGP on all auto-sign/encryption
       operations. To override and to use OpenSSL instead this must be _s_e_t.

       However, this has no effect while replying, since Mutt-ng will automatically
       select the same application that was used to sign/encrypt the original message.

       When sorting by threads, this variable controls how threads are sorted in rela-
       tion to other threads, and how the branches of the thread trees are sorted.
       This can be set to any value that ``_$_s_o_r_t (section 6.3.289  , page 134)'' can,
       except threads (in that case, Mutt-ng will just use date-sent).  You can also
       specify the ``last-'' prefix in addition to ``reverse-'' prefix, but last- must
       come after reverse-.  The last- prefix causes messages to be sorted against its
       siblings by which has the last descendant, using the rest of sort_aux as an
       ordering.

       For instance, set sort_aux=last-date-received would mean that if a new message
       is received in a thread, that thread becomes the last one displayed (or the
       first, if you have set sort=reverse-threads.)

               date
               size
               unsorted

       You may optionally use the ``reverse-'' prefix to specify reverse sorting order
       (example: set sort_browser=reverse-date).

       if the mailbox will not be written when exiting that mailbox (You can toggle
       whether to write changes to a mailbox with the toggle-write operation, bound by
       default to ``%'').  The fourth  is used to indicate that the current folder has

                   rent limit) *

                   134))

             %>X
                   right justify the rest of the string and pad with 'X'

             %|X
                   pad to the end of the line with 'X'

       * = can be optionally printed if nonzero

       Some of the above sequences can be used to optionally print a string if their
       value is nonzero.  For example, you may only want to see the number of flagged
       messages if such messages exist, since zero is not particularly meaningful.  To
       optionally print a string based upon one of the above sequences, the following

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                   141

       construct is used

       %?<sequence_char>?<optional_string>?

       where _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e___c_h_a_r is a character from the table above, and _o_p_t_i_o_n_a_l___s_t_r_i_n_g is
       the string you would like printed if _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e___c_h_a_r is nonzero.  _o_p_t_i_o_n_a_l___s_t_r_i_n_g
       mmaayy contain other sequences as well as normal text, but you may nnoott nest
       optional strings.

       Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of new mes-
       sages in a mailbox:

       %?n?%n new messages.?

       Additionally you can switch between two strings, the first one, if a value is
       zero, the second one, if the value is nonzero, by using the following con-
       struct:

       %?<sequence_char>?<if_string>&<else_string>?

       You can additionally force the result of any printf(3)-like sequence to be low-
       ercase by prefixing the sequence character with an underscore (_) sign.  For
       example, if you want to display the local hostname in lowercase, you would use:

       %_h

       If you prefix the sequence character with a colon (:) character, Mutt-ng will
       replace any dots in the expansion by underscores. This might be helpful with
       IMAP folders that don't like dots in folder names.

       Default: yes

       With mailto: style links, a body as well as arbitrary header information may be

       messages are often generated by old mailers or buggy mailers like MS Outlook
       Express).  See also _$_a_s_s_u_m_e_d___c_h_a_r_s_e_t (section 6.3.11  , page 67).

       This option also replaces linear-white-space between encoded-word and *text to
       a single space to prevent the display of MIME-encoded ``Subject:'' header field
       from being devided into multiple lines.

       sage threads.  By default, messages with the same subject are grouped together
       in ``pseudo threads.''  This may not always be desirable, such as in a personal
       mailbox where you might have several unrelated messages with the subject ``hi''
       which will get grouped together.

       Default: ' +TCFL'

       Controls the character used to indicate mail addressed to you.  The first char-
       acter is the one used when the mail is NOT addressed to your address (default:
       space).  The second is used when you are the only recipient of the message
       (default: +).  The third is when your address appears in the ``To:'' header
       field, but you are not the only recipient of the message (default: T).  The
       fourth character is used when your address is specified in the ``Cc:'' header
       field, but you are not the only recipient.  The fifth character is used to
       indicate mail that was sent by _y_o_u.  The sixth character is used to indicate
       when a mail was sent to a mailing-list you're subscribe to (default: L).

       _6_._3_._3_2_1  _t_r_a_s_h

       Type: path

       Default: ''

       If _s_e_t, this variable specifies the path of the trash folder where the mails
       marked for deletion will be moved, instead of being irremediably purged.

       NNoottee: When you delete a message in the trash folder, it is really deleted, so
       that there is no way to recover mail.

       _6_._3_._3_2_2  _t_u_n_n_e_l

       Type: string

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                   145

       Default: ''

       Setting this variable will cause Mutt-ng to open a pipe to a command instead of
       a raw socket. You may be able to use this to set up preauthenticated connec-
       tions to your IMAP/POP3 server. Example:

       tunnel='ssh -q mailhost.net /usr/local/libexec/imapd'

       NNoottee:: For this example to work you must be able to log in to the remote machine
       without having to enter a password.

       _6_._3_._3_2_3  _u_m_a_s_k

       Type: number

       Default: 0077

       This sets the umask that will be used by Mutt-ng when creating all kinds of
       files. If _u_n_s_e_t, the default value is 077.

       _6_._3_._3_2_4  _u_n_c_o_l_l_a_p_s_e___j_u_m_p

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will jump to the next unread message, if any, when the cur-
       rent thread is _u_ncollapsed.

       _6_._3_._3_2_5  _u_s_e___8_b_i_t_m_i_m_e

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       WWaarrnniinngg:: do not set this variable unless you are using a version of sendmail
       which supports the -B8BITMIME flag (such as sendmail 8.8.x) or you may not be
       able to send mail.

       When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will invoke ``_$_s_e_n_d_m_a_i_l (section 6.3.247  , page 124)'' with
       the -B8BITMIME flag when sending 8-bit messages to enable ESMTP negotiation.

       _6_._3_._3_2_6  _u_s_e___d_o_m_a_i_n

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will qualify all local addresses (ones without the @host por-
       tion) with the value of ``_$_h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e (section 6.3.89  , page 85)''.  If _u_n_s_e_t,
       no addresses will be qualified.

       _6_._3_._3_2_7  _u_s_e___f_r_o_m

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                   146

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will generate the ``From:'' header field when sending mes-
       sages. If _u_n_s_e_t, no ``From:'' header field will be generated unless the user
       explicitly sets one using the ``_m_y___h_d_r (section 3.13  , page 25)'' command.

       _6_._3_._3_2_8  _u_s_e___i_d_n

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       Availability: IDN

       When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will show you international domain names decoded.

       NNoottee:: You can use IDNs for addresses even if this is _u_n_s_e_t.  This variable only
       affects decoding.

       _6_._3_._3_2_9  _u_s_e___i_p_v_6

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will look for IPv6 addresses of hosts it tries to contact.
       If this option is _u_n_s_e_t, Mutt-ng will restrict itself to IPv4 addresses.  Nor-
       mally, the default should work.

       _6_._3_._3_3_0  _u_s_e_r___a_g_e_n_t

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will add a ``User-Agent:'' header to outgoing messages, indi-
       cating which version of Mutt-ng was used for composing them.

       _6_._3_._3_3_1  _v_i_s_u_a_l

       Type: path

       Default: ''

       Specifies the visual editor to invoke when the _~_v command is given in the
       builtin editor.

       _6_._3_._3_3_2  _w_a_i_t___k_e_y

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                   147

       Controls whether Mutt-ng will ask you to press a key after _s_h_e_l_l_- _e_s_c_a_p_e, _p_i_p_e_-
       _m_e_s_s_a_g_e, _p_i_p_e_-_e_n_t_r_y, _p_r_i_n_t_-_m_e_s_s_a_g_e, and _p_r_i_n_t_-_e_n_t_r_y commands.

       It is also used when viewing attachments with ``_a_u_t_o___v_i_e_w (section 5.4  , page
       60)'', provided that the corresponding mailcap entry has a needsterminal flag,
       and the external program is interactive.

       When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will always ask for a key. When _u_n_s_e_t, Mutt-ng will wait for
       a key only if the external command returned a non-zero status.

       _6_._3_._3_3_3  _w_e_e_d

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       When _s_e_t, Mutt-ng will weed headers when displaying, forwarding, printing, or
       replying to messages.

       _6_._3_._3_3_4  _w_r_a_p___s_e_a_r_c_h

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       Controls whether searches wrap around the end of the mailbox.

       When _s_e_t, searches will wrap around the first (or last) message. When _u_n_s_e_t,
       searches will not wrap.

       _6_._3_._3_3_5  _w_r_a_p_m_a_r_g_i_n

       Type: number

       Default: 0

       Controls the size of the margin remaining at the right side of the terminal
       when Mutt-ng's pager does smart wrapping.

       _6_._3_._3_3_6  _w_r_i_t_e___b_c_c

       Type: boolean

       Default: yes

       Controls whether Mutt-ng writes out the Bcc header when preparing messages to
       be sent.  Exim users may wish to _u_n_s_e_t this.

       _6_._3_._3_3_7  _w_r_i_t_e___i_n_c

       Type: number

       Default: 10

       The Mutt-ng E-Mail Client                                                   148

       When writing a mailbox, a message will be printed every _w_r_i_t_e___i_n_c messages to
       indicate progress.  If set to 0, only a single message will be displayed before
       writing a mailbox.

       Also see the ``_$_r_e_a_d___i_n_c (section 6.3.226  , page 119)'' variable.

       _6_._3_._3_3_8  _x_t_e_r_m___i_c_o_n

       Type: string

       Default: 'M%?n?AIL&ail?'

       Controls the format of the X11 icon title, as long as _$_x_t_e_r_m___s_e_t___t_i_t_l_e_s (sec-
       tion 6.3.340  , page 147) is _s_e_t. This string is identical in formatting to the
       one used by ``_$_s_t_a_t_u_s___f_o_r_m_a_t (section 6.3.305  , page 138)''.

       _6_._3_._3_3_9  _x_t_e_r_m___l_e_a_v_e

       Type: string

       Default: ''

       If _$_x_t_e_r_m___s_e_t___t_i_t_l_e_s (section 6.3.340  , page 147) is _s_e_t, this string will be
       used to set the title when leaving mutt-ng. For terminal-based programs,
       there's no easy and portable way to read the current title so mutt-ng cannot
       read it upon startup and restore it when exiting.

       Based on the xterm FAQ, the following might work:

       set xterm_leave = '`test x$DISPLAY != x && xprop -id $WINDOWID | grep WM_NAME |
       cut -d ''' -f 2`'

       Type: boolean

       Default: no

       Controls whether Mutt-ng sets the xterm title bar and icon name (as long as
       you're in an appropriate terminal). The default must be _u_n_s_e_t to force in the
       validity checking.

       _6_._3_._3_4_1  _x_t_e_r_m___t_i_t_l_e

       Type: string

       Default: 'Mutt-ng with %?m?%m messages&no messages?%?n? [%n New]?'

       Controls the format of the title bar of the xterm provided that
       _$_x_t_e_r_m___s_e_t___t_i_t_l_e_s (section 6.3.340  , page 147) has been _s_e_t. This string is
       identical in formatting to the one used by ``_$_s_t_a_t_u_s___f_o_r_m_a_t (section 6.3.305  ,
       page 138)''.

       _6_._4  _F_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_s

       The following is the list of available functions listed by the mapping in which
       they are available.  The default key setting is given, and an explanation of
       what the function does.  The key bindings of these functions can be changed
       with the _b_i_n_d (section 3.3  , page 17) command.

       _6_._4_._1  _g_e_n_e_r_i_c

       The _g_e_n_e_r_i_c menu is not a real menu, but specifies common functions (such as
       movement) available in all menus except for _p_a_g_e_r and _e_d_i_t_o_r.  Changing set-
       tings for this menu will affect the default bindings for all menus (except as
       noted).
