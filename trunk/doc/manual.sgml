<sect>Introduction
<p>
<bf/Mutt/ is a small but very powerful text-based MIME mail client.  Mutt is
highly configurable, and is well suited to the mail power user with advanced
features like key bindings, keyboard macros, mail threading, regular
expression searches and a powerful pattern matching language for selecting
groups of messages.

<sect>Getting Started
<p>

This section is intended as a brief overview of how to use Mutt.  There are
many other features which are described elsewhere in the manual.  There
is even more information available in the Mutt FAQ and various web
pages.  See the <htmlurl url="http://www.mutt.org/mutt/"
name="Mutt Page"> for more details.

The keybindings described in this section are the defaults as distributed.
Your local system administrator may have altered the defaults for your site.
You can always type ``?'' in any menu to display the current bindings.

The first thing you need to do is invoke mutt, simply by typing mutt
at the command line.  There are various command-line options, see 
either the mutt man page or the <ref id="commandline" name="reference">.

<sect1>Moving Around in Menus
<p>

Information is presented in menus, very similar to ELM.  Here is a table
showing the common keys used to navigate menus in Mutt.

<tscreen><verb>
j or Down       next-entry      move to the next entry
k or Up         previous-entry  move to the previous entry
z or PageDn     page-down       go to the next page
Z or PageUp     page-up         go to the previous page
= or Home       first-entry     jump to the first entry
* or End        last-entry      jump to the last entry
q               quit            exit the current menu
?               help            list all keybindings for the current menu
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Editing Input Fields<label id="editing">
<p>
Mutt has a builtin line editor which is used as the primary way to input
textual data such as email addresses or filenames.  The keys used to move
around while editing are very similar to those of Emacs.

<tscreen><verb>
^A or <Home>    bol             move to the start of the line
^B or <Left>    backward-char   move back one char
Esc B		backward-word	move back one word
^D or <Delete>  delete-char     delete the char under the cursor
^E or <End>     eol             move to the end of the line
^F or <Right>   forward-char    move forward one char
Esc F		forward-word	move forward one word
<Tab>           complete        complete filename or alias
^T              complete-query  complete address with query
^K              kill-eol        delete to the end of the line
ESC d		kill-eow	delete to the end ot the word
^W              kill-word       kill the word in front of the cursor
^U              kill-line       delete entire line
^V              quote-char      quote the next typed key
<Up>            history-up      recall previous string from history
<Down>          history-down    recall next string from history
<BackSpace>     backspace       kill the char in front of the cursor
Esc u		upcase-word	convert word to upper case
Esc l		downcase-word	convert word to lower case
Esc c		capitalize-word capitalize the word
^G              n/a             abort
<Return>        n/a             finish editing
</verb></tscreen>

You can remap the <em/editor/ functions using the <ref id="bind" name="bind">
command.  For example, to make the <em/Delete/ key delete the character in
front of the cursor rather than under, you could use

<tt/bind editor &lt;delete&gt; backspace/

<sect1>Reading Mail - The Index and Pager
<p>

Similar to many other mail clients, there are two modes in which mail is
read in Mutt.  The first is the index of messages in the mailbox, which is
called the ``index'' in Mutt.  The second mode is the display of the
message contents.  This is called the ``pager.''

The next few sections describe the functions provided in each of these
modes.

<sect2>The Message Index
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
c               change to a different mailbox
ESC c           change to a folder in read-only mode
C               copy the current message to another mailbox
ESC C           decode a message and copy it to a folder
ESC s           decode a message and save it to a folder
D               delete messages matching a pattern
d               delete the current message
F               mark as important
l               show messages matching a pattern
N               mark message as new
o               change the current sort method
O               reverse sort the mailbox
q               save changes and exit
s               save-message
T               tag messages matching a pattern
t               toggle the tag on a message
ESC t           toggle tag on entire message thread
U               undelete messages matching a pattern
u               undelete-message
v               view-attachments
x               abort changes and exit
<Return>        display-message
<Tab>           jump to the next new message
@               show the author's full e-mail address
$               save changes to mailbox
/               search
ESC /           search-reverse
^L              clear and redraw the screen
^T              untag messages matching a pattern
</verb></tscreen>

<sect3>Status Flags
<p>

In addition to who sent the message and the subject, a short summary of
the disposition of each message is printed beside the message number.
Zero or more of the following ``flags'' may appear, which mean:

<p>
<descrip>
<tag/D/ message is deleted (is marked for deletion)
<tag/d/ message have attachments marked for deletion
<tag/K/ contains a PGP public key
<tag/N/ message is new
<tag/O/ message is old
<tag/P/ message is PGP encrypted
<tag/r/ message has been replied to
<tag/S/ message is signed, and the signature is succesfully verified
<tag/s/ message is signed
<tag/!/ message is flagged
<tag/*/ message is tagged
</descrip>

Some of the status flags can be turned on or off using
<itemize>
<item><bf/set-flag/ (default: w)
<item><bf/clear-flag/ (default: W)
</itemize>

<p>
Furthermore, the following flags reflect who the message is addressed
to.  They can be customized with the
<ref id="to_chars" name="&dollar;to&lowbar;chars"> variable.

<p>
<descrip>
<tag/+/ message is to you and you only
<tag/T/ message is to you, but also to or cc'ed to others
<tag/C/ message is cc'ed to you
<tag/F/ message is from you
<tag/L/ message is sent to a subscribed mailing list
</descrip>

<sect2>The Pager
<p>

By default, Mutt uses its builtin pager to display the body of messages.
The pager is very similar to the Unix program <em/less/ though not nearly as
featureful.

<tscreen><verb>
<Return>        go down one line
<Space>         display the next page (or next message if at the end of a message)
-               go back to the previous page
n               search for next match
S               skip beyond quoted text
T               toggle display of quoted text
?               show keybindings
/               search for a regular expression (pattern)
ESC /           search backwards for a regular expression
\               toggle search pattern coloring
^               jump to the top of the message
</verb></tscreen>

In addition, many of the functions from the <em/index/ are available in
the pager, such as <em/delete-message/ or <em/copy-message/ (this is one
advantage over using an external pager to view messages).

Also, the internal pager supports a couple other advanced features. For
one, it will accept and translate the ``standard'' nroff sequences for
bold and underline. These sequences are a series of either the letter,
backspace (^H), the letter again for bold or the letter, backspace,
``&lowbar;'' for denoting underline. Mutt will attempt to display these
in bold and underline respectively if your terminal supports them. If
not, you can use the bold and underline <ref id="color" name="color">
objects to specify a color or mono attribute for them.

Additionally, the internal pager supports the ANSI escape sequences for
character attributes.  Mutt translates them into the correct color and
character settings.  The sequences Mutt supports are:

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
ESC [ Ps;Ps;Ps;...;Ps m
where Ps =
0    All Attributes Off
1    Bold on
4    Underline on
5    Blink on
7    Reverse video on
3x   Foreground color is x
4x   Background color is x

Colors are
0    black
1    red
2    green
3    yellow
4    blue
5    magenta
6    cyan
7    white
</verb></tscreen>

Mutt uses these attributes for handling text/enriched messages, and they
can also be used by an external <ref id="auto_view" name="autoview">
script for highlighting purposes.  <bf/Note:/ If you change the colors for your
display, for example by changing the color associated with color2 for
your xterm, then that color will be used instead of green.

<sect2>Threaded Mode<label id="threads">
<p>
When the mailbox is <ref id="sort" name="sorted"> by <em/threads/, there are
a few additional functions available in the <em/index/ and <em/pager/ modes.

<tscreen><verb>
^D      delete-thread           delete all messages in the current thread
^U      undelete-thread         undelete all messages in the current thread
^N      next-thread             jump to the start of the next thread
^P      previous-thread         jump to the start of the previous thread
^R      read-thread             mark the current thread as read
ESC d   delete-subthread        delete all messages in the current subthread
ESC u   undelete-subthread      undelete all messages in the current subthread
ESC n   next-subthread          jump to the start of the next subthread
ESC p   previous-subthread      jump to the start of the previous subthread
ESC r   read-subthread          mark the current subthread as read
ESC t   tag-thread              toggle the tag on the current thread
ESC v	collapse-thread		toggle collapse for the current thread
ESC V	collapse-all		toggle collapse for all threads
P       parent-message          jump to parent message in thread
</verb></tscreen>

<bf/Note:/ Collapsing a thread displays only the first message
in the thread and hides the others. This is useful when threads
contain so many messages that you can only see a handful of threads on
the screen. See %M in <ref id="index_format"name="&dollar;index&lowbar;format">.
For example, you could use "&percnt;?M?(#&percnt;03M)&amp;(&percnt;4l)?" in <ref
id="index_format"name="&dollar;index&lowbar;format"> to optionally
display the number of hidden messages if the thread is collapsed.

See also: <ref id="strict_threads" name="&dollar;strict&lowbar;threads">.

<sect2>Miscellaneous Functions
<p><bf/create-alias/<label id="create-alias"> (default: a)<newline>

Creates a new alias based upon the current message (or prompts for a
new one).  Once editing is complete, an <ref id="alias" name="alias">
command is added to the file specified by the <ref id="alias_file"
name="&dollar;alias&lowbar;file"> variable for future use. <bf/Note:/
Specifying an <ref id="alias_file" name="&dollar;alias&lowbar;file">
does not add the aliases specified there-in, you must also <ref
id="source" name="source"> the file.

<p><bf/check-traditional-pgp/<label id="check-traditional-pgp"> (default: ESC P)<newline>

This function will search the current message for content signed or
encrypted with PGP the "traditional" way, that is, without proper
MIME tagging.  Technically, this function will temporarily change
the MIME content types of the body parts containing PGP data; this
is similar to the <ref id="edit-type" name="edit-type"> function's
effect.


<p><bf/display-toggle-weed/<label id="display-toggle-weed"> (default: h)<newline>

Toggles the weeding of message header fields specified by <ref id="ignore"
name="ignore"> commands.

<p><bf/edit/<label id="edit"> (default: e)<newline>

This command (available in the ``index'' and ``pager'') allows you to
edit the raw current message as it's present in the mail folder.
After you have finished editing, the changed message will be
appended to the current folder, and the original message will be
marked for deletion.

<p><bf/edit-type/<label id="edit-type"><newline>
(default: ^E on the attachment menu, and in the pager and index menus; ^T on the
compose menu)

This command is used to temporarily edit an attachment's content
type to fix, for instance, bogus character set parameters.  When
invoked from the index or from the pager, you'll have the
opportunity to edit the top-level attachment's content type.  On the
<ref id="attach_menu" name="attachment menu">, you can change any
attachment's content type. These changes are not persistent, and get
lost upon changing folders.

Note that this command is also available on the <ref
id="compose_menu" name="compose menu">.  There, it's used to
fine-tune the properties of attachments you are going to send.

<p><bf/enter-command/<label id="enter-command"> (default: ``:'')<newline>

This command is used to execute any command you would normally put in a
configuration file.  A common use is to check the settings of variables, or
in conjunction with <ref id="macro" name="macros"> to change settings on the
fly.

<p><bf/extract-keys/<label id="extract-keys"> (default: ^K)<newline>

This command extracts PGP public keys from the current or tagged
message(s) and adds them to your PGP public key ring.

<p><bf/forget-passphrase/<label id="forget-passphrase"> (default:
^F)<newline> 

This command wipes the passphrase(s) from memory. It is useful, if
you misspelled the passphrase.

<p><bf/list-reply/<label id="list-reply"> (default: L)<newline>

Reply to the current or tagged message(s) by extracting any addresses which
match the addresses given by the <ref id="lists" name="lists or subscribe">
commands, but also honor any <tt/Mail-Followup-To/ header(s) if the
<ref id="honor_followup_to" name="&dollar;honor&lowbar;followup&lowbar;to">
configuration variable is set.  Using this when replying to messages posted
to mailing lists helps avoid duplicate copies being sent to the author of
the message you are replying to.

<bf/pipe-message/<label id="pipe-message"> (default: |)<newline>

Asks for an external Unix command and pipes the current or
tagged message(s) to it.  The variables <ref id="pipe_decode"
name="&dollar;pipe&lowbar;decode">, <ref id="pipe_split"
name="&dollar;pipe&lowbar;split">, <ref id="pipe_sep"
name="&dollar;pipe&lowbar;sep"> and <ref id="wait_key"
name="&dollar;wait&lowbar;key"> control the exact behaviour of this
function.

<bf/resend-message/<label id="resend-message"> (default: ESC e)<newline>

With resend-message, mutt takes the current message as a template for a
new message.  This function is best described as "recall from arbitrary
folders".  It can conveniently be used to forward MIME messages while
preserving the original mail structure. Note that the amount of headers
included here depends on the value of the <ref id="weed" name="&dollar;weed">
variable.

This function is also available from the attachment menu. You can use this
to easily resend a message which was included with a bounce message
as a message/rfc822 body part.

<bf/shell-escape/<label id="shell-escape"> (default: !)<newline>

Asks for an external Unix command and executes it.  The <ref
id="wait_key" name="&dollar;wait&lowbar;key"> can be used to control
whether Mutt will wait for a key to be pressed when the command returns
(presumably to let the user read the output of the command), based on
the return status of the named command.

<bf/toggle-quoted/<label id="toggle-quoted"> (default: T)<newline>

The <em/pager/ uses the <ref id="quote_regexp"
name="&dollar;quote&lowbar;regexp"> variable to detect quoted text when
displaying the body of the message.  This function toggles the display
of the quoted material in the message.  It is particularly useful when
are interested in just the response and there is a large amount of
quoted text in the way.

<bf/skip-quoted/<label id="skip-quoted"> (default: S)<newline>

This function will go to the next line of non-quoted text which come
after a line of quoted text in the internal pager.

<sect1>Sending Mail
<p>

The following bindings are available in the <em/index/ for sending
messages.

<tscreen><verb>
m       compose         compose a new message
r       reply           reply to sender
g       group-reply     reply to all recipients
L       list-reply      reply to mailing list address
f       forward         forward message
b       bounce          bounce (remail) message
ESC k   mail-key        mail a PGP public key to someone
</verb></tscreen>

Bouncing a message sends the message as is to the recipient you
specify.  Forwarding a message allows you to add comments or
modify the message you are forwarding.  These items are discussed
in greater detail in the next chapter <ref id="forwarding_mail"
name="``Forwarding and Bouncing Mail''">.

Mutt will then enter the <em/compose/ menu and prompt you for the
recipients to place on the ``To:'' header field.  Next, it will ask
you for the ``Subject:'' field for the message, providing a default if
you are replying to or forwarding a message.  See also <ref id="askcc"
name="&dollar;askcc">, <ref id="askbcc" name="&dollar;askbcc">, <ref
id="autoedit" name="&dollar;autoedit">, <ref id="bounce"
name="&dollar;bounce">, and <ref id="fast_reply"
name="&dollar;fast&lowbar;reply"> for changing how Mutt asks these
questions.

Mutt will then automatically start your <ref id="editor"
name="&dollar;editor"> on the message body.  If the <ref id="edit_headers"
name="&dollar;edit&lowbar;headers"> variable is set, the headers will be at
the top of the message in your editor.  Any messages you are replying
to will be added in sort order to the message, with appropriate <ref
id="attribution" name="&dollar;attribution">, <ref id="indent_string"
name="&dollar;indent&lowbar;string"> and <ref id="post_indent_string"
name="&dollar;post&lowbar;indent&lowbar;string">.  When forwarding a
message, if the <ref id="mime_forward" name="&dollar;mime&lowbar;forward">
variable is unset, a copy of the forwarded message will be included.  If
you have specified a <ref id="signature" name="&dollar;signature">, it
will be appended to the message.

Once you have finished editing the body of your mail message, you are
returned to the <em/compose/ menu.  The following options are available:

<tscreen><verb>
a       attach-file             attach a file
A	attach-message		attach message(s) to the message
ESC k   attach-key              attach a PGP public key
d       edit-description        edit description on attachment
D       detach-file             detach a file
t       edit-to                 edit the To field
ESC f   edit-from               edit the From field
r       edit-reply-to           edit the Reply-To field
c       edit-cc                 edit the Cc field
b       edit-bcc                edit the Bcc field
y       send-message            send the message
s       edit-subject            edit the Subject
S       smime-menu              select S/MIME options
f       edit-fcc                specify an ``Fcc'' mailbox
p       pgp-menu                select PGP options
P       postpone-message        postpone this message until later
q       quit                    quit (abort) sending the message
w	write-fcc		write the message to a folder
i       ispell                  check spelling (if available on your system)
^F      forget-passphrase       wipe passphrase(s) from memory
</verb></tscreen>

<bf/Note:/ The attach-message function will prompt you for a folder to
attach messages from. You can now tag messages in that folder and they
will be attached to the message you are sending. Note that certain
operations like composing a new mail, replying, forwarding, etc. are
not permitted when you are in that folder. The %r in <ref
id="status_format" name="&dollar;status&lowbar;format"> will change to
a 'A' to indicate that you are in attach-message mode.

<sect2>Editing the message header
<p>
When editing the header of your outgoing message, there are a couple of
special features available.

If you specify<newline>
<tt/Fcc:/ <em/filename/<newline>
Mutt will pick up <em/filename/
just as if you had used the <em/edit-fcc/ function in the <em/compose/ menu.

You can also attach files to your message by specifying<newline>
<tt/Attach:/ <em/filename/  &lsqb; <em/description/ &rsqb;<newline>
where <em/filename/ is the file to attach and <em/description/ is an
optional string to use as the description of the attached file.

When replying to messages, if you remove the <em/In-Reply-To:/ field from
the header field, Mutt will not generate a <em/References:/ field, which
allows you to create a new message thread.

Also see <ref id="edit_headers" name="edit&lowbar;headers">.

<sect2>Using Mutt with PGP

<p>
If you want to use PGP, you can specify 

<tt/Pgp:/ &lsqb; <tt/E/ | <tt/S/ | <tt/S&lt;id/&gt; &rsqb; <newline>

``E'' encrypts, ``S'' signs and
``S&lt;id&gt;'' signs with the given key, setting <ref
id="pgp_sign_as" name="&dollar;pgp&lowbar;sign&lowbar;as"> permanently.

If you have told mutt to PGP encrypt a message, it will guide you
through a key selection process when you try to send the message.
Mutt will not ask you any questions about keys which have a
certified user ID matching one of the message recipients' mail
addresses.  However, there may be situations in which there are
several keys, weakly certified user ID fields, or where no matching
keys can be found.

In these cases, you are dropped into a menu with a list of keys from
which you can select one.  When you quit this menu, or mutt can't
find any matching keys, you are prompted for a user ID.  You can, as
usually, abort this prompt using <tt/^G/.  When you do so, mutt will
return to the compose screen.

Once you have successfully finished the key selection, the message
will be encrypted using the selected public keys, and sent out.

Most fields of the entries in the key selection menu (see also <ref
id="pgp_entry_format" name="&dollar;pgp&lowbar;entry&lowbar;format">) 
have obvious meanings.  But some explanations on the capabilities, flags, 
and validity fields are in order.

The flags sequence (&percnt;f) will expand to one of the following flags:
<tscreen><verb>
R            The key has been revoked and can't be used.
X            The key is expired and can't be used.
d            You have marked the key as disabled.
c            There are unknown critical self-signature 
             packets.
</verb></tscreen>

The capabilities field (&percnt;c) expands to a two-character sequence
representing a key's capabilities.  The first character gives
the key's encryption capabilities: A minus sign (<bf/-/) means 
that the key cannot be used for encryption.  A dot (<bf/./) means that
it's marked as a signature key in one of the user IDs, but may 
also be used for encryption.  The letter <bf/e/ indicates that 
this key can be used for encryption.
 
The second character indicates the key's signing capabilities.  Once 
again, a ``<bf/-/'' implies ``not for signing'', ``<bf/./'' implies
that the key is marked as an encryption key in one of the user-ids, and
``<bf/s/'' denotes a key which can be used for signing.

Finally, the validity field (%t) indicates how well-certified a user-id
is.  A question mark (<bf/?/) indicates undefined validity, a minus 
character (<bf/-/) marks an untrusted association, a space character 
means a partially trusted association, and a plus character (<bf/+/) 
indicates complete validity.

<sect2>Sending anonymous messages via mixmaster.

<p>
You may also have configured mutt to co-operate with Mixmaster, an
anonymous remailer.  Mixmaster permits you to send your messages
anonymously using a chain of remailers. Mixmaster support in mutt is for 
mixmaster version 2.04 (beta 45 appears to be the latest) and 2.03. 
It does not support earlier versions or the later so-called version 3 betas, 
of which the latest appears to be called 2.9b23.

To use it, you'll have to obey certain restrictions.  Most
important, you cannot use the <tt/Cc/ and <tt/Bcc/ headers.  To tell
Mutt to use mixmaster, you have to select a remailer chain, using
the mix function on the compose menu.  

The chain selection screen is divided into two parts.  In the
(larger) upper part, you get a list of remailers you may use.  In
the lower part, you see the currently selected chain of remailers.

You can navigate in the chain using the <tt/chain-prev/ and
<tt/chain-next/ functions, which are by default bound to the left
and right arrows and to the <tt/h/ and <tt/l/ keys (think vi
keyboard bindings).  To insert a remailer at the current chain
position, use the <tt/insert/ function.  To append a remailer behind
the current chain position, use <tt/select-entry/ or <tt/append/.
You can also delete entries from the chain, using the corresponding
function.  Finally, to abandon your changes, leave the menu, or
<tt/accept/ them pressing (by default) the <tt/Return/ key.

Note that different remailers do have different capabilities,
indicated in the &percnt;c entry of the remailer menu lines (see
<ref id="mix_entry_format"
name="&dollar;mix&lowbar;entry&lowbar;format">).  Most important is
the ``middleman'' capability, indicated by a capital ``M'': This
means that the remailer in question cannot be used as the final
element of a chain, but will only forward messages to other
mixmaster remailers.  For details on the other capabilities, please
have a look at the mixmaster documentation.

<sect1>Forwarding and Bouncing Mail<label id="forwarding_mail">
<p>

Bouncing and forwarding let you send an existing message to recipients
that you specify.  Bouncing a message uses the <ref id="sendmail"
name="sendmail"> command to send a copy to alternative addresses as if
they were the message's original recipients.  Forwarding a message, on
the other hand, allows you to modify the message before it is resent
(for example, by adding your own comments).

The following keys are bound by default:

<tscreen><verb>
f       forward         forward message
b       bounce          bounce (remail) message
</verb></tscreen>

Forwarding can be done by including the original message in the new
message's body (surrounded by indicating lines) or including it as a MIME
attachment, depending on the value of the <ref id="mime_forward"
name="&dollar;mime&lowbar;forward"> variable.  Decoding of attachments,
like in the pager, can be controlled by the <ref id="forward_decode"
name="&dollar;forward&lowbar;decode"> and <ref id="mime_forward_decode"
name="&dollar;mime&lowbar;forward&lowbar;decode"> variables,
respectively.  The desired forwarding format may depend on the content,
therefore <em/&dollar;mime&lowbar;forward/ is a quadoption which, for
example, can be set to ``ask-no''.

The inclusion of headers is controlled by the current setting of the
<ref id="weed" name="&dollar;weed"> variable, unless <ref
id="mime_forward" name="mime&lowbar;forward"> is set.

Editing the message to forward follows the same procedure as sending or
replying to a message does.

<sect1>Postponing Mail<label id="postponing_mail">
<p>

At times it is desirable to delay sending a message that you have
already begun to compose.  When the <em/postpone-message/ function is
used in the <em/compose/ menu, the body of your message and attachments
are stored in the mailbox specified by the <ref id="postponed"
name="&dollar;postponed"> variable.  This means that you can recall the
message even if you exit Mutt and then restart it at a later time.

Once a message is postponed, there are several ways to resume it.  From the
command line you can use the ``-p'' option, or if you <em/compose/ a new
message from the <em/index/ or <em/pager/ you will be prompted if postponed
messages exist.  If multiple messages are currently postponed, the
<em/postponed/ menu will pop up and you can select which message you would
like to resume.

<bf/Note:/ If you postpone a reply to a message, the reply setting of
the message is only updated when you actually finish the message and
send it.  Also, you must be in the same folder with the message you
replied to for the status of the message to be updated.

See also the <ref id="postpone" name="&dollar;postpone"> quad-option.

<sect1>Reading news via NNTP<label id="reading_news">
<p>

If compiled with ``--enable-nntp'' option, Mutt can read news from newsserver
via NNTP.  You can open a newsgroup with function ``change-newsgroup''
(default: i).  Default newsserver can be obtained from <em/NNTPSERVER/
environment variable.  Like other news readers, info about subscribed
newsgroups is saved in file by <ref id="newsrc" name="&dollar;newsrc">
variable.  Article headers are cached and can be loaded from file when
newsgroup entered instead loading from newsserver.

<sect>Configuration
<p>

While the default configuration (or ``preferences'') make Mutt
usable right out of the box, it is often desirable to tailor Mutt to
suit your own tastes. When Mutt is first invoked, it will attempt to
read the ``system'' configuration file (defaults set by your local
system administrator), unless the ``-n'' <ref id="commandline"
name="command line"> option is specified.  This file is typically
<tt>/usr/local/share/mutt/Muttrc</tt> or <tt>/etc/Muttrc</tt>. Mutt
will next look for a file named <tt>.muttrc</tt> in your home
directory.  If this file does not exist and your home directory has
a subdirectory named <tt/.mutt/, mutt try to load a file named
<tt>.mutt/muttrc</tt>. 

<tt>.muttrc</tt> is the file where you will usually place your <ref
 id="commands" name="commands"> to configure Mutt.

In addition, mutt supports version specific configuration files that are
parsed instead of the default files as explained above.  For instance, if
your system has a <tt/Muttrc-0.88/ file in the system configuration
directory, and you are running version 0.88 of mutt, this file will be
sourced instead of the <tt/Muttrc/ file.  The same is true of the user
configuration file, if you have a file <tt/.muttrc-0.88.6/ in your home
directory, when you run mutt version 0.88.6, it will source this file
instead of the default <tt/.muttrc/ file.  The version number is the
same which is visible using the ``-v'' <ref id="commandline"
name="command line"> switch or using the <tt/show-version/ key (default:
V) from the index menu.

<sect1>Syntax of Initialization Files<label id="muttrc-syntax">
<p>

An initialization file consists of a series of <ref id="commands"
name="commands">.  Each line of the file may contain one or more commands.
When multiple commands are used, they must be separated by a semicolon (;).
<tscreen><verb>
set realname='Mutt user' ; ignore x-
</verb></tscreen>
The hash mark, or pound sign
(``&num;''), is used as a ``comment'' character. You can use it to
annotate your initialization file. All text after the comment character
to the end of the line is ignored. For example,

<tscreen><verb>
my_hdr X-Disclaimer: Why are you listening to me? &num; This is a comment
</verb></tscreen>

Single quotes (') and double quotes (&dquot;) can be used to quote strings
which contain spaces or other special characters.  The difference between
the two types of quotes is similar to that of many popular shell programs,
namely that a single quote is used to specify a literal string (one that is
not interpreted for shell variables or quoting with a backslash &lsqb;see
next paragraph&rsqb;), while double quotes indicate a string for which
should be evaluated.  For example, backtics are evaluated inside of double
quotes, but <bf/not/ for single quotes.

&bsol; quotes the next character, just as in shells such as bash and zsh.
For example, if want to put quotes ``&dquot;'' inside of a string, you can use
``&bsol;'' to force the next character to be a literal instead of interpreted
character.
<tscreen><verb>
set realname="Michael \"MuttDude\" Elkins"
</verb></tscreen>

``&bsol;&bsol;'' means to insert a literal ``&bsol;'' into the line.
``&bsol;n'' and ``&bsol;r'' have their usual C meanings of linefeed and
carriage-return, respectively.

A &bsol; at the end of a line can be used to split commands over
multiple lines, provided that the split points don't appear in the
middle of command names.

It is also possible to substitute the output of a Unix command in an
initialization file.  This is accomplished by enclosing the command in
backquotes (``).  For example,
<tscreen><verb>
my_hdr X-Operating-System: `uname -a`
</verb></tscreen>
The output of the Unix command ``uname -a'' will be substituted before the
line is parsed.  Note that since initialization files are line oriented, only
the first line of output from the Unix command will be substituted.

UNIX environments can be accessed like the way it is done in shells like
sh and bash: Prepend the name of the environment by a ``&dollar;''.  For
example,
<tscreen><verb>
set record=+sent_on_$HOSTNAME
</verb></tscreen>

The commands understood by mutt are explained in the next paragraphs.
For a complete list, see the <ref id="commands" name="command reference">.

<sect1>Defining/Using aliases<label id="alias">
<p>

Usage: <tt/alias/ <em/key/ <em/address/ &lsqb; , <em/address/, ... &rsqb;

It's usually very cumbersome to remember or type out the address of someone
you are communicating with.  Mutt allows you to create ``aliases'' which map
a short string to a full address.

<bf/Note:/ if you want to create an alias for a group (by specifying more than
one address), you <bf/must/ separate the addresses with a comma (``,'').

To remove an alias or aliases (``*'' means all aliases):

<tt/unalias/ &lsqb; * | <em/key/ <em/.../ &rsqb;

<tscreen><verb>
alias muttdude me@cs.hmc.edu (Michael Elkins)
alias theguys manny, moe, jack
</verb></tscreen>

Unlike other mailers, Mutt doesn't require aliases to be defined
in a special file.  The <tt/alias/ command can appear anywhere in
a configuration file, as long as this file is <ref id="source"
name="sourced">.  Consequently, you can have multiple alias files, or
you can have all aliases defined in your muttrc.

On the other hand, the <ref id="create-alias" name="create-alias">
function can use only one file, the one pointed to by the <ref
id="alias_file" name="&dollar;alias&lowbar;file"> variable (which is
<tt>&tilde;/.muttrc</tt> by default). This file is not special either,
in the sense that Mutt will happily append aliases to any file, but in
order for the new aliases to take effect you need to explicitly <ref
id="source" name="source"> this file too.

For example:

<tscreen><verb>
source /usr/local/share/Mutt.aliases
source ~/.mail_aliases
set alias_file=~/.mail_aliases
</verb></tscreen>

To use aliases, you merely use the alias at any place in mutt where mutt
prompts for addresses, such as the <em/To:/ or <em/Cc:/ prompt.  You can
also enter aliases in your editor at the appropriate headers if you have the
<ref id="edit_headers" name="&dollar;edit&lowbar;headers"> variable set.

In addition, at the various address prompts, you can use the tab character
to expand a partial alias to the full alias.  If there are multiple matches,
mutt will bring up a menu with the matching aliases.  In order to be
presented with the full list of aliases, you must hit tab with out a partial
alias, such as at the beginning of the prompt or after a comma denoting
multiple addresses.

In the alias menu, you can select as many aliases as you want with the
<em/select-entry/ key (default: RET), and use the <em/exit/ key
(default: q) to return to the address prompt.

<sect1>Changing the default key bindings<label id="bind">
<p>
Usage: <tt/bind/ <em/map/ <em/key/ <em/function/

This command allows you to change the default key bindings (operation
invoked when pressing a key).

<em/map/ specifies in which menu the binding belongs.  The currently
defined maps are:

<descrip>
<tag/generic/
This is not a real menu, but is used as a fallback for all of the other
menus except for the pager and editor modes.  If a key is not defined in
another menu, Mutt will look for a binding to use in this menu.  This allows
you to bind a key to a certain function in multiple menus instead of having
multiple bind statements to accomplish the same task.
<tag/alias/
The alias menu is the list of your personal aliases as defined in your
muttrc.  It is the mapping from a short alias name to the full email
address(es) of the recipient(s).
<tag/attach/
The attachment menu is used to access the attachments on received messages.
<tag/browser/
The browser is used for both browsing the local directory structure, and for
listing all of your incoming mailboxes.
<tag/editor/
The editor is the line-based editor the user enters text data.
<tag/index/
The index is the list of messages contained in a mailbox.
<tag/compose/
The compose menu is the screen used when sending a new message.
<tag/pager/
The pager is the mode used to display message/attachment data, and help
listings.
<tag/pgp/
The pgp menu is used to select the OpenPGP keys used for encrypting outgoing
messages.
<tag/postpone/
The postpone menu is similar to the index menu, except is used when
recalling a message the user was composing, but saved until later.
</descrip>

<em/key/ is the key (or key sequence) you wish to bind.  To specify a
control character, use the sequence <em/&bsol;Cx/, where <em/x/ is the
letter of the control character (for example, to specify control-A use
``&bsol;Ca'').  Note that the case of <em/x/ as well as <em/&bsol;C/ is
ignored, so that <em/&bsol;CA, &bsol;Ca, &bsol;cA/ and <em/&bsol;ca/ are all
equivalent.  An alternative form is to specify the key as a three digit
octal number prefixed with a ``&bsol;'' (for example <em/&bsol;177/ is
equivalent to <em/&bsol;c?/).

In addition, <em/key/ may consist of:

<tscreen><verb>
\t              tab
<tab>           tab
\r              carriage return
\n              newline
\e              escape
<esc>           escape
<up>            up arrow
<down>          down arrow
<left>          left arrow
<right>         right arrow
<pageup>        Page Up
<pagedown>      Page Down
<backspace>     Backspace
<delete>        Delete
<insert>        Insert
<enter>         Enter
<return>        Return
<home>          Home
<end>           End
<space>         Space bar
<f1>            function key 1
<f10>           function key 10
</verb></tscreen>

<em/key/ does not need to be enclosed in quotes unless it contains a
space (`` '').

<em/function/ specifies which action to take when <em/key/ is pressed.
For a complete list of functions, see the <ref id="functions"
name="reference">.  The special function <tt/noop/ unbinds the specified key
sequence.

<sect1>Defining aliases for character sets <label id="charset-hook">
<p>
Usage: <tt/charset-hook/ <em/alias/ <em/charset/<newline>
Usage: <tt/iconv-hook/ <em/charset/ <em/local-charset/

The <tt/charset-hook/ command defines an alias for a character set.
This is useful to properly display messages which are tagged with a
character set name not known to mutt.

The <tt/iconv-hook/ command defines a system-specific name for a
character set.  This is helpful when your systems character
conversion library insists on using strange, system-specific names
for character sets.


<sect1>Setting variables based upon mailbox<label id="folder-hook">
<p>
Usage: <tt/folder-hook/ &lsqb;!&rsqb;<em/regexp/ <em/command/

It is often desirable to change settings based on which mailbox you are
reading.  The folder-hook command provides a method by which you can execute
any configuration command.  <em/regexp/ is a regular expression specifying
in which mailboxes to execute <em/command/ before loading.  If a mailbox
matches multiple folder-hook's, they are executed in the order given in the
muttrc.

<bf/Note:/ if you use the ``!'' shortcut for <ref id="spoolfile"
name="&dollar;spoolfile"> at the beginning of the pattern, you must place it
inside of double or single quotes in order to distinguish it from the
logical <em/not/ operator for the expression.

Note that the settings are <em/not/ restored when you leave the mailbox.
For example, a command action to perform is to change the sorting method
based upon the mailbox being read:

<tscreen><verb>
folder-hook mutt set sort=threads
</verb></tscreen>

However, the sorting method is not restored to its previous value when
reading a different mailbox.  To specify a <em/default/ command, use the
pattern ``.'':

<p>
<tscreen><verb>
folder-hook . set sort=date-sent
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Keyboard macros<label id="macro">
<p>
Usage: <tt/macro/ <em/menu/ <em/key/ <em/sequence/ &lsqb; <em/description/ &rsqb;

Macros are useful when you would like a single key to perform a series of
actions.  When you press <em/key/ in menu <em/menu/, Mutt will behave as if
you had typed <em/sequence/.  So if you have a common sequence of commands
you type, you can create a macro to execute those commands with a single
key.

<em/key/ and <em/sequence/ are expanded by the same rules as the <ref
id="bind" name="key bindings">.  There are some additions however.  The
first is that control characters in <em/sequence/ can also be specified
as <em/&circ;x/.  In order to get a caret (`&circ;'') you need to use
<em/&circ;&circ;/.  Secondly, to specify a certain key such as <em/up/
or to invoke a function directly, you can use the format
<em/&lt;key name&gt;/ and <em/&lt;function name&gt;/.  For a listing of key
names see the section on <ref id="bind" name="key bindings">.  Functions
are listed in the <ref id="functions" name="function reference">.

The advantage with using function names directly is that the macros will
work regardless of the current key bindings, so they are not dependent on
the user having particular key definitions.  This makes them more robust
and portable, and also facilitates defining of macros in files used by more
than one user (eg. the system Muttrc).

Optionally you can specify a descriptive text after <em/sequence/,
which is shown in the help screens.

<bf/Note:/ Macro definitions (if any) listed in the help screen(s), are
silently truncated at the screen width, and are not wrapped.   

<sect1>Using color and mono video attributes<label id="color">
<p>
Usage: <tt/color/ <em/object/ <em/foreground/ <em/background/ &lsqb; <em/regexp/ &rsqb;<newline>
Usage: <tt/color/ index <em/foreground/ <em/background/ <em/pattern/<newline>
Usage: <tt/uncolor/ index <em/pattern/ &lsqb; <em/pattern/ ...  &rsqb;<newline>

If your terminal supports color, you can spice up Mutt by creating your own
color scheme.  To define the color of an object (type of information), you
must specify both a foreground color <bf/and/ a background color (it is not
possible to only specify one or the other).

<em/object/ can be one of:

<itemize>
<item>attachment
<item>body (match <em/regexp/ in the body of messages)
<item>bold (hiliting bold patterns in the body of messages)
<item>error (error messages printed by Mutt)
<item>header (match <em/regexp/ in the message header)
<item>hdrdefault (default color of the message header in the pager)
<item>index (match <em/pattern/ in the message index)
<item>indicator (arrow or bar used to indicate the current item in a menu)
<item>markers (the ``+'' markers at the beginning of wrapped lines in the pager)
<item>message (informational messages)
<item>normal
<item>quoted (text matching <ref id="quote_regexp"
name="&dollar;quote&lowbar;regexp"> in the body of a message)
<item>quoted1, quoted2, ..., quoted<bf/N/ (higher levels of quoting)
<item>search (hiliting of words in the pager)
<item>signature
<item>status (mode lines used to display info about the mailbox or message)
<item>tilde (the ``&tilde;'' used to pad blank lines in the pager)
<item>tree (thread tree drawn in the message index and attachment menu)
<item>underline (hiliting underlined patterns in the body of messages)
</itemize>

<em/foreground/ and <em/background/ can be one of the following:

<itemize>
<item>white
<item>black
<item>green
<item>magenta
<item>blue
<item>cyan
<item>yellow
<item>red
<item>default
<item>color<em/x/
</itemize>

<em/foreground/ can optionally be prefixed with the keyword <tt/bright/ to make
the foreground color boldfaced (e.g., <tt/brightred/).

If your terminal supports it, the special keyword <em/default/ can be
used as a transparent color.  The value <em/brightdefault/ is also valid.
If Mutt is linked against the <em/S-Lang/ library, you also need to set
the <em/COLORFGBG/ environment variable to the default colors of your
terminal for this to work; for example (for Bourne-like shells):

<tscreen><verb>
set COLORFGBG="green;black"
export COLORFGBG
</verb></tscreen>

<bf/Note:/ The <em/S-Lang/ library requires you to use the <em/lightgray/
and <em/brown/ keywords instead of <em/white/ and <em/yellow/ when
setting this variable.

<bf/Note:/ The uncolor command can be applied to the index object only.  It
removes entries from the list. You <bf/must/ specify the same pattern
specified in the color command for it to be removed.  The pattern ``*'' is
a special token which means to clear the color index list of all entries.

Mutt also recognizes the keywords <em/color0/, <em/color1/, &hellip;,
<em/color/<bf/N-1/ (<bf/N/ being the number of colors supported
by your terminal).  This is useful when you remap the colors for your
display (for example by changing the color associated with <em/color2/
for your xterm), since color names may then lose their normal meaning.

If your terminal does not support color, it is still possible change the video
attributes through the use of the ``mono'' command:

Usage: <tt/mono/ <em/&lt;object&gt; &lt;attribute&gt;/ &lsqb; <em/regexp/ &rsqb;<newline>
Usage: <tt/mono/ index <em/attribute/ <em/pattern/<newline>
Usage: <tt/unmono/ index <em/pattern/ &lsqb; <em/pattern/ ...  &rsqb;<newline>

where <em/attribute/ is one of the following:

<itemize>
<item>none
<item>bold
<item>underline
<item>reverse
<item>standout
</itemize>

<sect1>Ignoring (weeding) unwanted message headers<label id="ignore">
<p>
Usage: <tt/&lsqb;un&rsqb;ignore/ <em/pattern/ &lsqb; <em/pattern/ ... &rsqb;

Messages often have many header fields added by automatic processing systems,
or which may not seem useful to display on the screen.  This command allows
you to specify header fields which you don't normally want to see.

You do not need to specify the full header field name.  For example,
``ignore content-'' will ignore all header fields that begin with the pattern
``content-''. ``ignore *'' will ignore all headers.

To remove a previously added token from the list, use the ``unignore'' command.
The ``unignore'' command will make Mutt display headers with the given pattern.
For example, if you do ``ignore x-'' it is possible to ``unignore x-mailer''.

``unignore *'' will remove all tokens from the ignore list.

For example:
<tscreen><verb>
# Sven's draconian header weeding
ignore *
unignore from date subject to cc
unignore organization organisation x-mailer: x-newsreader: x-mailing-list:
unignore posted-to:
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Alternative addresses<label id="alternates">
<p>
Usage: <tt/&lsqb;un&rsqb;alternates/ <em/regexp/ &lsqb; <em/regexp/ ... &rsqb;<newline>

With various functions, mutt will treat messages differently,
depending on whether you sent them or whether you received them from
someone else.  For instance, when replying to a message that you
sent to a different party, mutt will automatically suggest to send
the response to the original message's recipients -- responding to
yourself won't make much sense in many cases.  (See <ref
id="reply_to" name="&dollar;reply_to">.)

Many users receive e-mail under a number of different addresses. To
fully use mutt's features here, the program must be able to
recognize what e-mail addresses you receive mail under. That's the
purpose of the <tt/alternates/ command: It takes a list of regular
expressions, each of which can identify an address under which you
receive e-mail.

To remove a regular expression from this list, use the
<tt/unalternates/ command.

<sect1>Mailing lists<label id="lists">
<p>
Usage: <tt/&lsqb;un&rsqb;lists/ <em/regexp/ &lsqb; <em/regexp/ ... &rsqb;<newline>
Usage: <tt/&lsqb;un&rsqb;subscribe/ <em/regexp/ &lsqb; <em/regexp/ ... &rsqb;

Mutt has a few nice features for <ref id="using_lists" name="handling
mailing lists">.  In order to take advantage of them, you must
specify which addresses belong to mailing lists, and which mailing
lists you are subscribed to.  Once you have done this, the <ref
id="list-reply" name="list-reply"> function will work for all known lists.
Additionally, when you send a message to a subscribed list, mutt will
add a Mail-Followup-To header to tell other users' mail user agents
not to send copies of replies to your personal address.   Note that
the Mail-Followup-To header is a non-standard extension which is not
supported by all mail user agents.  Adding it is not bullet-proof against
receiving personal CCs of list messages.  Also note that the generation
of the Mail-Followup-To header is controlled by the <ref id="followup_to"
name="&dollar;followup_to"> configuration variable.

More precisely, Mutt maintains lists of patterns for the addresses
of known and subscribed mailing lists.  Every subscribed mailing
list is known. To mark a mailing list as known, use the ``lists''
command.  To mark it as subscribed, use ``subscribe''.

You can use regular expressions with both commands.  To mark all
messages sent to a specific bug report's address on mutt's bug
tracking system as list mail, for instance, you could say
``subscribe [0-9]*@bugs.guug.de''.  Often, it's sufficient to just
give a portion of the list's e-mail address.

Specify as much of the address as you need to to remove ambiguity.  For
example, if you've subscribed to the Mutt mailing list, you will receive mail
addresssed to <em/mutt-users@mutt.org/.  So, to tell Mutt that this is a
mailing list, you could add ``lists mutt-users'' to your
initialization file.  To tell mutt that you are subscribed to it,
add ``subscribe mutt-users'' to your initialization file instead.
If you also happen to get mail from someone whose address is
<em/mutt-users@example.com/, you could use ``lists mutt-users@mutt.org'' 
or ``subscribe mutt-users@mutt.org'' to
match only mail from the actual list.

The ``unlists'' command is used to remove a token from the list of
known and subscribed mailing-lists. Use ``unlists *'' to remove all
tokens.

To remove a mailing list from the list of subscribed mailing lists,
but keep it on the list of known mailing lists, use ``unsubscribe''.

<sect1>Using Multiple spool mailboxes<label id="mbox-hook">
<p>
Usage: <tt/mbox-hook/ &lsqb;!&rsqb;<em/pattern/ <em/mailbox/

This command is used to move read messages from a specified mailbox to a
different mailbox automatically when you quit or change folders.
<em/pattern/ is a regular expression specifying the mailbox to treat as a
``spool'' mailbox and <em/mailbox/ specifies where mail should be saved when
read.

Unlike some of the other <em/hook/ commands, only the <em/first/ matching
pattern is used (it is not possible to save read mail in more than a single
mailbox).

<sect1>Defining mailboxes which receive mail<label id="mailboxes">
<p>
Usage: <tt/&lsqb;un&rsqb;mailboxes/ &lsqb;!&rsqb;<em/filename/ &lsqb; <em/filename/ ... &rsqb;

This command specifies folders which can receive mail and
which will be checked for new messages.  By default, the
main menu status bar displays how many of these folders have
new messages.
<p>
When changing folders, pressing <em/space/ will cycle
through folders with new mail.
<p>
Pressing TAB in the directory browser will bring up a menu showing the files
specified by the <tt/mailboxes/ command, and indicate which contain new
messages.  Mutt will automatically enter this mode when invoked from the
command line with the <tt/-y/ option.

The ``unmailboxes'' command is used to remove a token from the list
of folders which receive mail. Use ``unmailboxes *'' to remove all
tokens.

<p>
<bf/Note:/ new mail is detected by comparing the last modification time to
the last access time.  Utilities like <tt/biff/ or <tt/frm/ or any other
program which accesses the mailbox might cause Mutt to never detect new mail
for that mailbox if they do not properly reset the access time.  Backup
tools are another common reason for updated access times.
<p>

<bf/Note:/ the filenames in the <tt/mailboxes/ command are resolved when
the command is executed, so if these names contain <ref id="shortcuts"
name="shortcut characters"> (such as ``='' and ``!''), any variable
definition that affect these characters (like <ref id="folder"
name="&dollar;folder"> and <ref id="spoolfile" name="&dollar;spoolfile">)
should be executed before the <tt/mailboxes/ command.

<sect1>User defined headers<label id="my_hdr">
<p>
Usage:<newline>
<tt/my_hdr/ <em/string/<newline>
<tt/unmy_hdr/ <em/field/ &lsqb; <em/field/ ... &rsqb;

The ``my&lowbar;hdr'' command allows you to create your own header
fields which will be added to every message you send.

For example, if you would like to add an ``Organization:'' header field to
all of your outgoing messages, you can put the command

<quote>
my_hdr Organization: A Really Big Company, Anytown, USA
</quote>

in your <tt/.muttrc/.

<bf/Note:/  space characters are <em/not/ allowed between the keyword and
the colon (``:'').  The standard for electronic mail (RFC822) says that
space is illegal there, so Mutt enforces the rule.

If you would like to add a header field to a single message, you should
either set the <ref id="edit_headers" name="edit&lowbar;headers"> variable,
or use the <em/edit-headers/ function (default: ``E'') in the send-menu so
that you can edit the header of your message along with the body.

To remove user defined header fields, use the ``unmy&lowbar;hdr''
command.  You may specify an asterisk (``*'') to remove all header
fields, or the fields to remove.  For example, to remove all ``To'' and
``Cc'' header fields, you could use:

<quote>
unmy_hdr to cc
</quote>

<sect1>Defining the order of headers when viewing messages<label id="hdr_order">
<p>
Usage: <tt/hdr&lowbar;order/ <em/header1/ <em/header2/ <em/header3/

With this command, you can specify an order in which mutt will attempt
to present headers to you when viewing messages.

``unhdr_order *'' will clear all previous headers from the order list,
thus removing the header order effects set by the system-wide startup
file.

<tscreen><verb>
hdr&lowbar;order From Date: From: To: Cc: Subject:
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Specify default save filename<label id="save-hook">
<p>
Usage: <tt/save-hook/ &lsqb;!&rsqb;<em/pattern/ <em/filename/

This command is used to override the default filename used when saving
messages.  <em/filename/ will be used as the default filename if the message is
<em/From:/ an address matching <em/regexp/ or if you are the author and the
message is addressed <em/to:/ something matching <em/regexp/.

See <ref id="pattern_hook" name="Message Matching in Hooks"> for information on the exact format of <em/pattern/.

Examples:

<tscreen><verb>
save-hook me@(turing\\.)?cs\\.hmc\\.edu$ +elkins
save-hook aol\\.com$ +spam
</verb></tscreen>

Also see the <ref id="fcc-save-hook" name="fcc-save-hook"> command.

<sect1>Specify default Fcc: mailbox when composing<label id="fcc-hook">
<p>
Usage: <tt/fcc-hook/ &lsqb;!&rsqb;<em/pattern/ <em/mailbox/

This command is used to save outgoing mail in a mailbox other than
<ref id="record" name="&dollar;record">.  Mutt searches the initial list of
message recipients for the first matching <em/regexp/ and uses <em/mailbox/
as the default Fcc: mailbox.  If no match is found the message will be saved
to <ref id="record" name="&dollar;record"> mailbox.

See <ref id="pattern_hook" name="Message Matching in Hooks"> for information on the exact format of <em/pattern/.

Example: <tt/fcc-hook aol.com&dollar; +spammers/

The above will save a copy of all messages going to the aol.com domain to
the `+spammers' mailbox by default.  Also see the <ref id="fcc-save-hook" 
name="fcc-save-hook"> command.

<sect1>Specify default save filename and default Fcc: mailbox at once<label
id="fcc-save-hook">
<p>
Usage: <tt/fcc-save-hook/ &lsqb;!&rsqb;<em/pattern/ <em/mailbox/

This command is a shortcut, equivalent to doing both a <ref id="fcc-hook" name="fcc-hook">
and a <ref id="save-hook" name="save-hook"> with its arguments.

<sect1>Change settings based upon message recipients<label id="send-hook"><label id="reply-hook">
<p>
Usage: <tt/reply-hook/ &lsqb;!&rsqb;<em/pattern/ <em/command/<newline>
Usage: <tt/send-hook/ &lsqb;!&rsqb;<em/pattern/ <em/command/

These commands can be used to execute arbitrary configuration commands based
upon recipients of the message.  <em/pattern/ is a regular expression
matching the desired address.  <em/command/ is executed when <em/regexp/
matches recipients of the message.

<tt/reply-hook/ is matched against the message you are <em/replying/
<bf/to/, instead of the message you are <em/sending/.  <tt/send-hook/ is
matched against all messages, both <em/new/ and <em/replies/.  <bf/Note:/
<tt/reply-hook/s are matched <bf/before/ the <tt/send-hook/, <bf/regardless/
of the order specified in the users's configuration file.

For each type of <tt/send-hook/ or <tt/reply-hook/, When multiple matches
occur, commands are executed in the order they are specified in the muttrc
(for that type of hook).

See <ref id="pattern_hook" name="Message Matching in Hooks"> for information on the exact format of <em/pattern/.

Example: <tt/send-hook mutt &dquot;set mime&lowbar;forward signature=''&dquot;/

Another typical use for this command is to change the values of the
<ref id="attribution" name="&dollar;attribution">, <ref id="signature"
name="&dollar;signature"> and <ref id="locale" name="&dollar;locale">
variables in order to change the language of the attributions and
signatures based upon the recipients.

<bf/Note:/ the send-hook's are only executed ONCE after getting the initial
list of recipients.  Adding a recipient after replying or editing the
message will NOT cause any send-hook to be executed.  Also note that
my_hdr commands which modify recipient headers, or the message's
subject, don't have any effect on the current message when executed
from a send-hook.

<sect1>Change settings before formatting a message<label id="message-hook">
<p>
Usage: <tt/message-hook/ &lsqb;!&rsqb;<em/pattern/ <em/command/

This command can be used to execute arbitrary configuration commands
before viewing or formatting a message based upon information about the message.
<em/command/ is executed if the <em/pattern/ matches the message to be
displayed. When multiple matches occur, commands are executed in the order
they are specified in the muttrc.

See <ref id="pattern_hook" name="Message Matching in Hooks"> for
information on the exact format of <em/pattern/.

Example:
<tscreen><verb>
message-hook ~A 'set pager=builtin'
message-hook '~f freshmeat-news' 'set pager="less \"+/^  subject: .*\""'
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Choosing the cryptographic key of the recipient<label id="crypt-hook">
<p>
Usage: <tt/crypt-hook/ <em/pattern/ <em/keyid/

When encrypting messages with PGP or OpenSSL, you may want to associate a certain
key with a given e-mail address automatically, either because the
recipient's public key can't be deduced from the destination address,
or because, for some reasons, you need to override the key Mutt would
normally use.  The crypt-hook command provides a method by which you can
specify the ID of the public key to be used when encrypting messages to
a certain recipient.

The meaning of "key id" is to be taken broadly in this context:  You
can either put a numerical key ID here, an e-mail address, or even
just a real name.

<sect1>Adding key sequences to the keyboard buffer<label id="push">
<p>
Usage: <tt/push/ <em/string/

This command adds the named string to the keyboard buffer. The string may
contain control characters, key names and function names like the sequence
string in the <ref id="macro" name="macro"> command. You may use it to
automatically run a sequence of commands at startup, or when entering
certain folders.

<sect1>Executing functions<label id="exec">
<p>
Usage: <tt/exec/ <em/function/ &lsqb; <em/function/ ... &rsqb;

This command can be used to execute any function. Functions are
listed in the <ref id="functions" name="function reference">.
``exec function'' is equivalent to ``push &lt;function&gt;''.

<sect1>Message Scoring<label id="score-command">
<p>
Usage: <tt/score/ <em/pattern/ <em/value/<newline>
Usage: <tt/unscore/ <em/pattern/ &lsqb; <em/pattern/ ... &rsqb;

The <tt/score/ commands adds <em/value/ to a message's score if <em/pattern/
matches it.  <em/pattern/ is a string in the format described in the <ref
id="patterns" name="patterns"> section (note: For efficiency reasons, patterns
which scan information not available in the index, such as <tt>&tilde;b</tt>,
<tt>&tilde;B</tt> or <tt>&tilde;h</tt>, may not be used).  <em/value/ is a
positive or negative integer.  A message's final score is the sum total of all
matching <tt/score/ entries.  However, you may optionally prefix <em/value/ with
an equal sign (=) to cause evaluation to stop at a particular entry if there is
a match.  Negative final scores are rounded up to 0.

The <tt/unscore/ command removes score entries from the list.  You <bf/must/
specify the same pattern specified in the <tt/score/ command for it to be
removed.  The pattern ``*'' is a special token which means to clear the list
of all score entries.

<sect1>Setting variables<label id="set">
<p>
Usage: <tt/set/ &lsqb;no|inv&rsqb;<em/variable/&lsqb;=<em/value/&rsqb; &lsqb; <em/variable/ ... &rsqb;<newline>
Usage: <tt/toggle/ <em/variable/ &lsqb;<em/variable/ ... &rsqb;<newline>
Usage: <tt/unset/ <em/variable/ &lsqb;<em/variable/ ... &rsqb;<newline>
Usage: <tt/reset/ <em/variable/ &lsqb;<em/variable/ ... &rsqb;

This command is used to set (and unset) <ref id="variables"
name="configuration variables">.  There are four basic types of variables:
boolean, number, string and quadoption.  <em/boolean/ variables can be
<em/set/ (true) or <em/unset/ (false).  <em/number/ variables can be
assigned a positive integer value.

<em/string/ variables consist of any number of printable characters.
<em/strings/ must be enclosed in quotes if they contain spaces or tabs.  You
may also use the ``C'' escape sequences <bf/&bsol;n/ and <bf/&bsol;t/ for
newline and tab, respectively.

<em/quadoption/ variables are used to control whether or not to be prompted
for certain actions, or to specify a default action.  A value of <em/yes/
will cause the action to be carried out automatically as if you had answered
yes to the question.  Similarly, a value of <em/no/ will cause the the
action to be carried out as if you had answered ``no.''  A value of
<em/ask-yes/ will cause a prompt with a default answer of ``yes'' and
<em/ask-no/ will provide a default answer of ``no.''

Prefixing a variable with ``no'' will unset it.  Example: <tt/set noaskbcc/.

For <em/boolean/ variables, you may optionally prefix the variable name with
<tt/inv/ to toggle the value (on or off).  This is useful when writing
macros.  Example: <tt/set invsmart&lowbar;wrap/.

The <tt/toggle/ command automatically prepends the <tt/inv/ prefix to all
specified variables.

The <tt/unset/ command automatically prepends the <tt/no/ prefix to all
specified variables.

Using the enter-command function in the <em/index/ menu, you can query the
value of a variable by prefixing the name of the variable with a question
mark:

<tscreen><verb>
set ?allow_8bit
</verb></tscreen>

The question mark is actually only required for boolean and quadoption 
variables.

The <tt/reset/ command resets all given variables to the compile time
defaults (hopefully mentioned in this manual). If you use the command
<tt/set/ and prefix the variable with ``&amp;'' this has the same
behavior as the reset command.

With the <tt/reset/ command there exists the special variable ``all'',
which allows you to reset all variables to their system defaults.

<sect1>Reading initialization commands from another file<label id="source">
<p>
Usage: <tt/source/ <em/filename/ &lsqb; <em/filename/ ... &rsqb;

This command allows the inclusion of initialization commands
from other files.  For example, I place all of my aliases in
<tt>&tilde;/.mail&lowbar;aliases</tt> so that I can make my
<tt>&tilde;/.muttrc</tt> readable and keep my aliases private.

If the filename begins with a tilde (``&tilde;''), it will be expanded to the
path of your home directory.

If the filename ends with a vertical bar (|), then <em/filename/ is
considered to be an executable program from which to read input (eg.
<tt/source ~/bin/myscript|/).

<sect1>Removing hooks<label id="unhook">
<p>
Usage: <tt/unhook/ &lsqb; * | <em/hook-type/ &rsqb;

This command permits you to flush hooks you have previously defined.
You can either remove all hooks by giving the ``*'' character as an
argument, or you can remove all hooks of a specific type by saying
something like <tt/unhook send-hook/.

<sect>Advanced Usage

<sect1>Regular Expressions<label id="regexp">
<p>
All string patterns in Mutt including those in more complex
<ref id="patterns" name="patterns"> must be specified
using regular expressions (regexp) in the ``POSIX extended'' syntax (which
is more or less the syntax used by egrep and GNU awk).  For your
convenience, we have included below a brief description of this syntax.

The search is case sensitive if the pattern contains at least one upper
case letter, and case insensitive otherwise. Note that ``&bsol;''
must be quoted if used for a regular expression in an initialization
command: ``&bsol;&bsol;''.

A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings.
Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic
expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.

Note that the regular expression can be enclosed/delimited by either &dquot;
or ' which is useful if the regular expression includes a white-space
character.  See <ref id="muttrc-syntax" name="Syntax of Initialization Files">
for more information on &dquot; and ' delimiter processing.  To match a
literal &dquot; or ' you must preface it with \ (backslash).

The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match
a single character.  Most characters, including all letters and digits,
are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any metacharacter with
special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.

The period ``.'' matches any single character.  The caret ``&circ;'' and
the dollar sign ``&dollar'' are metacharacters that respectively match
the empty string at the beginning and end of a line.

A list of characters enclosed by ``&lsqb;'' and ``&rsqb;'' matches any
single character in that list; if the first character of the list
is a caret ``&circ;'' then it matches any character <bf/not/ in the
list.  For example, the regular expression <bf/&lsqb;0123456789&rsqb;/
matches any single digit.  A range of ASCII characters may be specified
by giving the first and last characters, separated by a hyphen
``&hyphen;''.  Most metacharacters lose their special meaning inside
lists.  To include a literal ``&rsqb;'' place it first in the list.
Similarly, to include a literal ``&circ;'' place it anywhere but first.
Finally, to include a literal hyphen ``&hyphen;'' place it last.

Certain named classes of characters are predefined.  Character classes
consist of ``&lsqb;:'', a keyword denoting the class, and ``:&rsqb;''.
The following classes are defined by the POSIX standard:

<descrip>
<tag/&lsqb;:alnum:&rsqb;/
Alphanumeric characters.
<tag/&lsqb;:alpha:&rsqb;/
Alphabetic characters.
<tag/&lsqb;:blank:&rsqb;/
Space or tab characters.
<tag/&lsqb;:cntrl:&rsqb;/
Control characters.
<tag/&lsqb;:digit:&rsqb;/
Numeric characters.
<tag/&lsqb;:graph:&rsqb;/
Characters that are both printable and visible.  (A space is printable,
but not visible, while an ``a'' is both.)
<tag/&lsqb;:lower:&rsqb;/
Lower-case alphabetic characters.
<tag/&lsqb;:print:&rsqb;/
Printable characters (characters that are not control characters.)
<tag/&lsqb;:punct:&rsqb;/
Punctuation characters (characters that are not letter, digits, control
characters, or space characters).
<tag/&lsqb;:space:&rsqb;/
Space characters (such as space, tab and formfeed, to name a few).
<tag/&lsqb;:upper:&rsqb;/
Upper-case alphabetic characters.
<tag/&lsqb;:xdigit:&rsqb;/
Characters that are hexadecimal digits.
</descrip>

A character class is only valid in a regular expression inside the
brackets of a character list.  Note that the brackets in these
class names are part of the symbolic names, and must be included
in addition to the brackets delimiting the bracket list.  For
example, <bf/&lsqb;&lsqb;:digit:&rsqb;&rsqb;/ is equivalent to
<bf/&lsqb;0-9&rsqb;/.

Two additional special sequences can appear in character lists.  These
apply to non-ASCII character sets, which can have single symbols (called
collating elements) that are represented with more than one character,
as well as several characters that are equivalent for collating or
sorting purposes:

<descrip>
<tag/Collating Symbols/
A collating symbol is a multi-character collating element enclosed in
``&lsqb;.'' and ``.&rsqb;''.  For example, if ``ch'' is a collating
element, then <bf/&lsqb;&lsqb;.ch.&rsqb;&rsqb;/ is a regexp that matches
this collating element, while <bf/&lsqb;ch&rsqb;/ is a regexp that
matches either ``c'' or ``h''.
<tag/Equivalence Classes/
An equivalence class is a locale-specific name for a list of
characters that are equivalent. The name is enclosed in ``&lsqb;=''
and ``=&rsqb;''.  For example, the name ``e'' might be used to
represent all of ``&egrave;'' ``&eacute;'' and ``e''.  In this case,
<bf/&lsqb;&lsqb;=e=&rsqb;&rsqb;/ is a regexp that matches any of
``&egrave;'', ``&eacute;'' and ``e''.
</descrip>

A regular expression matching a single character may be followed by one
of several repetition operators:

<descrip>
<tag/?/
The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
<tag/*/
The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
<tag/+/
The preceding item will be matched one or more times.
<tag/&lcub;n&rcub;/
The preceding item is matched exactly <em/n/ times.
<tag/&lcub;n,&rcub;/
The preceding item is matched <em/n/ or more times.
<tag/&lcub;,m&rcub;/
The preceding item is matched at most <em/m/ times.
<tag/&lcub;n,m&rcub;/
The preceding item is matched at least <em/n/ times, but no more than
<em/m/ times.
</descrip>

Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular
expression matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings
that respectively match the concatenated subexpressions.

Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator ``|'';
the resulting regular expression matches any string matching either
subexpression.

Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes
precedence over alternation.  A whole subexpression may be enclosed in
parentheses to override these precedence rules.

<bf/Note:/ If you compile Mutt with the GNU <em/rx/ package, the
following operators may also be used in regular expressions:

<descrip>
<tag/&bsol;&bsol;y/
Matches the empty string at either the beginning or the end of a word.
<tag/&bsol;&bsol;B/
Matches the empty string within a word.
<tag/&bsol;&bsol;&lt;/
Matches the empty string at the beginning of a word.
<tag/&bsol;&bsol;&gt;/
Matches the empty string at the end of a word.
<tag/&bsol;&bsol;w/
Matches any word-constituent character (letter, digit, or underscore).
<tag/&bsol;&bsol;W/
Matches any character that is not word-constituent.
<tag/&bsol;&bsol;`/
Matches the empty string at the beginning of a buffer (string).
<tag/&bsol;&bsol;'/
Matches the empty string at the end of a buffer.
</descrip>

Please note however that these operators are not defined by POSIX, so
they may or may not be available in stock libraries on various systems.

<sect1>Patterns<label id="patterns">
<p>
Many of Mutt's commands allow you to specify a pattern to match
(limit, tag-pattern, delete-pattern, etc.).  There are several ways to select
messages:

<tscreen><verb>
~A              all messages
~b EXPR         messages which contain EXPR in the message body
~B EXPR         messages which contain EXPR in the whole message
~c USER         messages carbon-copied to USER
~C EXPR         message is either to: or cc: EXPR
~D              deleted messages
~d [MIN]-[MAX]  messages with ``date-sent'' in a Date range
~E              expired messages
~e EXPR         message which contains EXPR in the ``Sender'' field
~F              flagged messages
~f USER         messages originating from USER
~g              cryptographically signed messages
~G              cryptographically encrypted messages
~h EXPR         messages which contain EXPR in the message header
~k		message contains PGP key material
~i ID           message which match ID in the ``Message-ID'' field
~L EXPR         message is either originated or received by EXPR
~l              message is addressed to a known mailing list
~m [MIN]-[MAX]  message in the range MIN to MAX *)
~n [MIN]-[MAX]  messages with a score in the range MIN to MAX *)
~N              new messages
~O              old messages
~p              message is addressed to you (consults alternates)
~P              message is from you (consults alternates)
~Q              messages which have been replied to
~R              read messages
~r [MIN]-[MAX]  messages with ``date-received'' in a Date range
~S              superseded messages
~s SUBJECT      messages having SUBJECT in the ``Subject'' field.
~T              tagged messages
~t USER         messages addressed to USER
~U              unread messages
~v		message is part of a collapsed thread.
~V		cryptographically verified messages
~x EXPR         messages which contain EXPR in the `References' field
~y EXPR         messages which contain EXPR in the `X-Label' field

</verb></tscreen>

Where EXPR, USER, ID, and SUBJECT are 
<ref id="regexp" name="regular expressions">.  Special attention has to be
made when using regular expressions inside of patterns.  Specifically,
Mutt's parser for these patterns will strip one level of backslash (\),
which is normally used for quoting.  If it is your intention to use a
backslash in the regular expression, you will need to use two backslashes
instead (\\).

*) The forms <tt/&lt;&lsqb;MAX&rsqb;/, <tt/&gt;&lsqb;MIN&rsqb;/,

are allowed, too.

<sect2>Pattern Modifier
<p>

Note that patterns matching 'lists' of addresses (notably c,C,p,P and t)
match if there is at least one match in the whole list. If you want to
make sure that all elements of that list match, you need to prefix your
pattern with ^.
This example matches all mails which only has recipients from Germany.

<tscreen><verb>
^~C \.de$
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Complex Patterns
<p>

Logical AND is performed by specifying more than one criterion.  For
example:

<tscreen><verb>
~t mutt ~f elkins
</verb></tscreen>

would select messages which contain the word ``mutt'' in the list of
recipients <bf/and/ that have the word ``elkins'' in the ``From'' header
field.

Mutt also recognizes the following operators to create more complex search
patterns:

<itemize>
<item>! -- logical NOT operator
<item>| -- logical OR operator
<item>() -- logical grouping operator
</itemize>

Here is an example illustrating a complex search pattern.  This pattern will
select all messages which do not contain ``mutt'' in the ``To'' or ``Cc''
field and which are from ``elkins''.

<tscreen><verb>
!(~t mutt|~c mutt) ~f elkins
</verb></tscreen>

Here is an example using white space in the regular expression (note
the ' and &dquot; delimiters).  For this to match, the mail's subject must
match the ``^Junk +From +Me$'' and it must be from either ``Jim +Somebody''
or ``Ed +SomeoneElse'':

<tscreen><verb>
 '~s "^Junk +From +Me$" ~f ("Jim +Somebody"|"Ed +SomeoneElse")'
</verb></tscreen>

Note that if a regular expression contains parenthesis, or a veritical bar
("|"), you <bf/must/ enclose the expression in double or single quotes since
those characters are also used to separate different parts of Mutt's
pattern language.  For example,

<tscreen><verb>
~f "me@(mutt\.org|cs\.hmc\.edu)"
</verb></tscreen>

Without the quotes, the parenthesis would truncate the regular expression
to simply <em/me@/, which is probably not what you want.

<sect2>Searching by Date
<p>
Mutt supports two types of dates, <em/absolute/ and <em/relative/.

<bf/Absolute/.  Dates <bf/must/ be in DD/MM/YY format (month and year are
optional, defaulting to the current month and year).  An example of a valid
range of dates is:

<tscreen><verb>
Limit to messages matching: ~d 20/1/95-31/10
</verb></tscreen>

If you omit the minimum (first) date, and just specify ``-DD/MM/YY'', all
messages <em/before/ the given date will be selected.  If you omit the maximum
(second) date, and specify ``DD/MM/YY-'', all messages <em/after/ the given
date will be selected.  If you specify a single date with no dash (``-''),
only messages sent on the given date will be selected. 

<bf/Error Margins/.  You can add error margins to absolute dates.
An error margin is a sign (+ or -), followed by a digit, followed by
one of the following units:
<verb>
y	years
m	months
w	weeks
d	days
</verb>
As a special case, you can replace the sign by a ``*'' character,
which is equivalent to giving identical plus and minus error margins.

Example: To select any messages two weeks around January 15, 2001,
you'd use the following pattern: 
<tscreen><verb> 
Limit to messages matching: ~d 15/1/2001*2w
</verb></tscreen>


<bf/Relative/.  This type of date is relative to the current date, and may
be specified as:
<itemize>
<item>&gt;<em/offset/ (messages older than <em/offset/ units)
<item>&lt;<em/offset/ (messages newer than <em/offset/ units)
<item>=<em/offset/ (messages exactly <em/offset/ units old)
</itemize>

<em/offset/ is specified as a positive number with one of the following
units:
<verb>
y       years
m       months
w       weeks
d       days
</verb>

Example: to select messages less than 1 month old, you would use
<tscreen><verb>
Limit to messages matching: ~d <1m
</verb></tscreen>



<bf/Note:/ all dates used when searching are relative to the
<bf/local/ time zone, so unless you change the setting of your <ref
id="index_format" name="&dollar;index&lowbar;format"> to include a
<tt/&percnt;&lsqb;...&rsqb;/ format, these are <bf/not/ the dates shown
in the main index.

<sect1>Using Tags
<p>

Sometimes it is desirable to perform an operation on a group of
messages all at once rather than one at a time.  An example might be
to save messages to a mailing list to a separate folder, or to
delete all messages with a given subject.  To tag all messages
matching a pattern, use the tag-pattern function, which is bound to
``shift-T'' by default.  Or you can select individual messages by
hand using the ``tag-message'' function, which is bound to ``t'' by
default.  See <ref id="patterns" name="patterns"> for Mutt's pattern
matching syntax.

Once you have tagged the desired messages, you can use the
``tag-prefix'' operator, which is the ``;'' (semicolon) key by default.
When the ``tag-prefix'' operator is used, the <bf/next/ operation will
be applied to all tagged messages if that operation can be used in that
manner.  If the <ref id="auto_tag" name="&dollar;auto&lowbar;tag">
variable is set, the next operation applies to the tagged messages
automatically, without requiring the ``tag-prefix''.

<sect1>Using Hooks<label id="hooks">
<p>
A <em/hook/ is a concept borrowed from the EMACS editor which allows you to
execute arbitrary commands before performing some operation.  For example,
you may wish to tailor your configuration based upon which mailbox you are
reading, or to whom you are sending mail.  In the Mutt world, a <em/hook/
consists of a <ref id="regexp" name="regular expression"> or
<ref id="patterns" name="pattern"> along with a
configuration option/command.  See
<itemize>
<item><ref id="folder-hook" name="folder-hook">
<item><ref id="send-hook" name="send-hook">
<item><ref id="message-hook" name="message-hook">
<item><ref id="save-hook" name="save-hook">
<item><ref id="mbox-hook" name="mbox-hook">
<item><ref id="fcc-hook" name="fcc-hook">
<item><ref id="fcc-save-hook" name="fcc-save-hook">
</itemize>
for specific details on each type of <em/hook/ available.

<bf/Note:/ if a hook changes configuration settings, these changes remain
effective until the end of the current mutt session. As this is generally
not desired, a default hook needs to be added before all other hooks to
restore configuration defaults. Here is an example with send-hook and the
my_hdr directive:

<tscreen><verb>
send-hook . 'unmy_hdr From:'
send-hook ~Cb@b.b my_hdr from: c@c.c
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Message Matching in Hooks<label id="pattern_hook">
<p>
Hooks that act upon messages (<tt/send-hook, save-hook, fcc-hook,
message-hook/) are evaluated in a slightly different manner.  For the other
types of hooks, a <ref id="regexp" name="regular expression"> is
sufficient.  But in dealing with messages a finer grain of control is
needed for matching since for different purposes you want to match
different criteria.

Mutt allows the use of the <ref id="patterns" name="search pattern">
language for matching messages in hook commands.  This works in
exactly the same way as it would when <em/limiting/ or
<em/searching/ the mailbox, except that you are restricted to those
operators which match information mutt extracts from the header of
the message (i.e.  from, to, cc, date, subject, etc.).

For example, if you wanted to set your return address based upon sending
mail to a specific address, you could do something like:
<tscreen><verb>
send-hook '~t ^me@cs\.hmc\.edu$' 'my_hdr From: Mutt User <user@host>'
</verb></tscreen>
which would execute the given command when sending mail to
<em/me@cs.hmc.edu/.

However, it is not required that you write the pattern to match using the
full searching language.  You can still specify a simple <em/regular
expression/ like the other hooks, in which case Mutt will translate your
pattern into the full language, using the translation specified by the 
<ref id="default_hook" name="&dollar;default&lowbar;hook"> variable.  The
pattern is translated at the time the hook is declared, so the value of 
<ref id="default_hook" name="&dollar;default&lowbar;hook"> that is in effect
at that time will be used.

<sect1>External Address Queries<label id="query">
<p>
Mutt supports connecting to external directory databases such as LDAP,
ph/qi, bbdb, or NIS through a wrapper script which connects to mutt
using a simple interface.  Using the <ref id="query_command"
name="&dollar;query&lowbar;command"> variable, you specify the wrapper
command to use.  For example:

<tscreen><verb>
set query_command = "mutt_ldap_query.pl '%s'"
</verb></tscreen>

The wrapper script should accept the query on the command-line.  It
should return a one line message, then each matching response on a
single line, each line containing a tab separated address then name then
some other optional information.  On error, or if there are no matching
addresses, return a non-zero exit code and a one line error message.

An example multiple response output:
<tscreen><verb>
Searching database ... 20 entries ... 3 matching:
me@cs.hmc.edu           Michael Elkins  mutt dude
blong@fiction.net       Brandon Long    mutt and more
roessler@guug.de        Thomas Roessler mutt pgp
</verb></tscreen>

There are two mechanisms for accessing the query function of mutt.  One
is to do a query from the index menu using the query function (default: Q).
This will prompt for a query, then bring up the query menu which will
list the matching responses.  From the query menu, you can select
addresses to create aliases, or to mail.  You can tag multiple messages
to mail, start a new query, or have a new query appended to the current
responses.

The other mechanism for accessing the query function is for address
completion, similar to the alias completion.  In any prompt for address
entry, you can use the complete-query function (default: ^T) to run a
query based on the current address you have typed.  Like aliases, mutt
will look for what you have typed back to the last space or comma.  If
there is a single response for that query, mutt will expand the address
in place.  If there are multiple responses, mutt will activate the query
menu.  At the query menu, you can select one or more addresses to be
added to the prompt.

<sect1>Mailbox Formats
<p>
Mutt supports reading and writing of four different mailbox formats:
mbox, MMDF, MH and Maildir.  The mailbox type is autodetected, so there
is no need to use a flag for different mailbox types.  When creating new
mailboxes, Mutt uses the default specified with the <ref id="mbox_type"
name="&dollar;mbox&lowbar;type"> variable.

<bf/mbox/.  This is the most widely used mailbox format for UNIX.  All
messages are stored in a single file.  Each message has a line of the form:

<tscreen><verb>
From me@cs.hmc.edu Fri, 11 Apr 1997 11:44:56 PST
</verb></tscreen>

to denote the start of a new message (this is often referred to as the
``From&lowbar;'' line).

<bf/MMDF/.  This is a variant of the <em/mbox/ format.  Each message is
surrounded by lines containing ``^A^A^A^A'' (four control-A's).

<bf/MH/. A radical departure from <em/mbox/ and <em/MMDF/, a mailbox
consists of a directory and each message is stored in a separate file.
The filename indicates the message number (however, this is may not
correspond to the message number Mutt displays). Deleted messages are
renamed with a comma (,) prepended to the filename. <bf/Note:/ Mutt
detects this type of mailbox by looking for either <tt/.mh&lowbar;sequences/
or <tt/.xmhcache/ (needed to distinguish normal directories from MH
mailboxes).

<bf/Maildir/.  The newest of the mailbox formats, used by the Qmail MTA (a
replacement for sendmail).  Similar to <em/MH/, except that it adds three
subdirectories of the mailbox: <em/tmp/, <em/new/ and <em/cur/.  Filenames
for the messages are chosen in such a way they are unique, even when two
programs are writing the mailbox over NFS, which means that no file locking
is needed.

<sect1>Mailbox Shortcuts<label id="shortcuts">
<p>
There are a number of built in shortcuts which refer to specific mailboxes.
These shortcuts can be used anywhere you are prompted for a file or mailbox
path.

<itemize>
<item>! -- refers to your <ref id="spoolfile" name="&dollar;spoolfile"> (incoming) mailbox
<item>&gt; -- refers to your <ref id="mbox" name="&dollar;mbox"> file
<item>&lt; -- refers to your <ref id="record" name="&dollar;record"> file
<item>- or !! -- refers to the file you've last visited
<item>&tilde; -- refers to your home directory
<item>= or + -- refers to your <ref id="folder" name="&dollar;folder"> directory
<item>@<em/alias/ -- refers to the <ref id="save-hook" 
name="default save folder"> as determined by the address of the alias
</itemize>

<sect1>Handling Mailing Lists<label id="using_lists">
<p>

Mutt has a few configuration options that make dealing with large
amounts of mail easier.  The first thing you must do is to let Mutt
know what addresses you consider to be mailing lists (technically
this does not have to be a mailing list, but that is what it is most
often used for), and what lists you are subscribed to.  This is
accomplished through the use of the <ref id="lists"
name="lists and subscribe"> commands in your muttrc.

Now that Mutt knows what your mailing lists are, it can do several
things, the first of which is the ability to show the name of a list
through which you received a message (i.e., of a subscribed list) in
the <em/index/ menu display.  This is useful to distinguish between
personal and list mail in the same mailbox.  In the <ref id="index_format"
name="&dollar;index&lowbar;format"> variable, the escape ``&percnt;L''
will return the string ``To &lt;list&gt;'' when ``list'' appears in the
``To'' field, and ``Cc &lt;list&gt;'' when it appears in the ``Cc''
field (otherwise it returns the name of the author).

Often times the ``To'' and ``Cc'' fields in mailing list messages
tend to get quite large. Most people do not bother to remove the
author of the message they are reply to from the list, resulting in
two or more copies being sent to that person.  The ``list-reply''
function, which by default is bound to ``L'' in the <em/index/ menu
and <em/pager/, helps reduce the clutter by only replying to the
known mailing list addresses instead of all recipients (except as
specified by <tt/Mail-Followup-To/, see below).

Mutt also supports the <tt/Mail-Followup-To/ header.  When you send
a message to a list of recipients which includes one or several
subscribed mailing lists, and if the <ref id="followup_to"
name="&dollar;followup&lowbar;to"> option is set, mutt will generate
a Mail-Followup-To header which contains all the recipients to whom
you send this message, but not your address. This indicates that
group-replies or list-replies (also known as ``followups'') to this
message should only be sent to the original recipients of the
message, and not separately to you - you'll receive your copy through
one of the mailing lists you are subscribed to.

Conversely, when group-replying or list-replying to a message which
has a <tt/Mail-Followup-To/ header, mutt will respect this header if
the <ref id="honor_followup_to"
name="&dollar;honor&lowbar;followup&lowbar;to"> configuration
variable is set.  Using list-reply will in this case also make sure
that the reply goes to the mailing list, even if it's not specified
in the list of recipients in the <tt/Mail-Followup-To/.

Note that, when header editing is enabled, you can create a
<tt/Mail-Followup-To/ header manually.  Mutt will only auto-generate
this header if it doesn't exist when you send the message.


The other method some mailing list admins use is to generate a
``Reply-To'' field which points back to the mailing list address rather
than the author of the message.  This can create problems when trying
to reply directly to the author in private, since most mail clients
will automatically reply to the address given in the ``Reply-To''
field.  Mutt uses the <ref id="reply_to" name="&dollar;reply&lowbar;to">
variable to help decide which address to use.  If set, you will be
prompted as to whether or not you would like to use the address given in
the ``Reply-To'' field, or reply directly to the address given in the
``From'' field.  When unset, the ``Reply-To'' field will be used when
present.

The ``X-Label:'' header field can be used to further identify mailing
lists or list subject matter (or just to annotate messages
individually).  The <ref id="index_format"
name="&dollar;index&lowbar;format"> variable's ``&percnt;y'' and
``&percnt;Y'' escapes can be used to expand ``X-Label:'' fields in the
index, and Mutt's pattern-matcher can match regular expressions to
``X-Label:'' fields with the ``~y'' selector.  ``X-Label:'' is not a
standard message header field, but it can easily be inserted by procmail
and other mail filtering agents.

Lastly, Mutt has the ability to <ref id="sort" name="sort"> the mailbox into
<ref id="threads" name="threads">.  A thread is a group of messages which all relate to the same
subject.  This is usually organized into a tree-like structure where a
message and all of its replies are represented graphically.  If you've ever
used a threaded news client, this is the same concept.  It makes dealing
with large volume mailing lists easier because you can easily delete
uninteresting threads and quickly find topics of value.

<sect1>Delivery Status Notification (DSN) Support
<p>
RFC1894 defines a set of MIME content types for relaying information
about the status of electronic mail messages.  These can be thought of as
``return receipts.'' Berkeley sendmail 8.8.x currently has some command
line options in which the mail client can make requests as to what type
of status messages should be returned.

To support this, there are two variables. <ref id="dsn_notify"
name="&dollar;dsn&lowbar;notify"> is used to request receipts for
different results (such as failed message, message delivered, etc.).
<ref id="dsn_return" name="&dollar;dsn&lowbar;return"> requests how much
of your message should be returned with the receipt (headers or full
message).  Refer to the man page on sendmail for more details on DSN.

<sect1>POP3 Support (OPTIONAL)
<p>

If Mutt was compiled with POP3 support (by running the <em/configure/
script with the <em/--enable-pop/ flag), it has the ability to work
with mailboxes located on a remote POP3 server and fetch mail for local
browsing.

You can access the remote POP3 mailbox by selecting the folder
<tt>pop://popserver/</tt>.

You can select an alternative port by specifying it with the server, ie:
<tt>pop://popserver:port/</tt>.

You can also specify different username for each folder, ie:
<tt>pop://username@popserver[:port]/</tt>.

Polling for new mail is more expensive over POP3 than locally. For this
reason the frequency at which Mutt will check for mail remotely can be
controlled by the
<ref id="pop&lowbar;checkinterval" name="&dollar;pop&lowbar;checkinterval">
variable, which defaults to every 60 seconds.

If Mutt was compiled with SSL support (by running the <em/configure/
script with the <em/--with-ssl/ flag), connections to POP3 servers
can be encrypted. This naturally requires that the server supports
SSL encrypted connections. To access a folder with POP3/SSL, you should
use pops: prefix, ie:
<tt>pops://[username@]popserver[:port]/</tt>.

Another way to access your POP3 mail is the <em/fetch-mail/ function
(default: G).  It allows to connect to <ref id="pop_host"
name="pop&lowbar;host">, fetch all your new mail and place it in the
local <ref id="spoolfile" name="spoolfile">.  After this
point, Mutt runs exactly as if the mail had always been local.

<bf/Note:/ If you only need to fetch all messages to local mailbox
you should consider using a specialized program, such as <htmlurl
url="http://www.ccil.org/~esr/fetchmail" name="fetchmail">

<sect1>IMAP Support (OPTIONAL)
<p>

If Mutt was compiled with IMAP support (by running the <em/configure/
script with the <em/--enable-imap/ flag), it has the ability to work
with folders located on a remote IMAP server.

You can access the remote inbox by selecting the folder
<tt>imap://imapserver/INBOX</tt>, where <tt/imapserver/ is the name of the
IMAP server and <tt/INBOX/ is the special name for your spool mailbox on
the IMAP server. If you want to access another mail folder at the IMAP
server, you should use <tt>imap://imapserver/path/to/folder</tt> where
<tt>path/to/folder</tt> is the path of the folder you want to access.

You can select an alternative port by specifying it with the server, ie:
<tt>imap://imapserver:port/INBOX</tt>.

You can also specify different username for each folder, ie:
<tt>imap://username@imapserver[:port]/INBOX</tt>.

If Mutt was compiled with SSL support (by running the <em/configure/
script with the <em/--with-ssl/ flag), connections to IMAP servers
can be encrypted. This naturally requires that the server supports
SSL encrypted connections. To access a folder with IMAP/SSL, you should
use <tt>imaps://[username@]imapserver[:port]/path/to/folder</tt> as your 
folder path.

Pine-compatible notation is also supported, ie
<tt>{[username@]imapserver[:port][/ssl]}path/to/folder</tt>

Note that not all servers use / as the hierarchy separator.  Mutt should
correctly notice which separator is being used by the server and convert
paths accordingly.

When browsing folders on an IMAP server, you can toggle whether to look
at only the folders you are subscribed to, or all folders with the
<em/toggle-subscribed/ command.  See also the 
<ref id="imap&lowbar;list&lowbar;subscribed"
name="&dollar;imap&lowbar;list&lowbar;subscribed"> variable.

Polling for new mail on an IMAP server can cause noticeable delays. So, you'll
want to carefully tune the
<ref id="mail&lowbar;check" name="&dollar;mail&lowbar;check">
and
<ref id="timeout" name="&dollar;timeout">
variables. Personally I use
<tscreen><verb>
set mail_check=90
set timeout=15
</verb></tscreen>
with relatively good results over my slow modem line.

Note that if you are using mbox as the mail store on UW servers prior to
v12.250, the server has been reported to disconnect a client if another client
selects the same folder.

<sect2>The Folder Browser
<p>

As of version 1.2, mutt supports browsing mailboxes on an IMAP
server. This is mostly the same as the local file browser, with the
following differences:
<itemize>
<item>In lieu of file permissions, mutt displays the string "IMAP",
  possibly followed by the symbol "+", indicating
  that the entry contains both messages and subfolders. On
  Cyrus-like servers folders will often contain both messages and
  subfolders. 
<item>For the case where an entry can contain both messages and
  subfolders, the selection key (bound to <tt>enter</tt> by default)
  will choose to descend into the subfolder view. If you wish to view
  the messages in that folder, you must use <tt>view-file</tt> instead
  (bound to <tt>space</tt> by default).
<item>You can delete mailboxes with the <tt>delete-mailbox</tt>
  command (bound to <tt>d</tt> by default. You may also
  <tt>subscribe</tt> and <tt>unsubscribe</tt> to mailboxes (normally
  these are bound to <tt>s</tt> and <tt>u</tt>, respectively).
</itemize>

<sect2>Authentication
<p>

Mutt supports four authentication methods with IMAP servers: SASL,
GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, and LOGIN (there is a patch by Grant Edwards to add
NTLM authentication for you poor exchange users out there, but it has
yet to be integrated into the main tree). There is also support for
the pseudo-protocol ANONYMOUS, which allows you to log in to a public
IMAP server without having an account. To use ANONYMOUS, simply make
your username blank or "anonymous".
<p>
SASL is a special super-authenticator, which selects among several protocols
(including GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, ANONYMOUS, and DIGEST-MD5) the most secure
method available on your host and the server. Using some of these methods
(including DIGEST-MD5 and possibly GSSAPI), your entire session will be
encrypted and invisible to those teeming network snoops. It is the best
option if you have it. To use it, you must have the Cyrus SASL library
installed on your system and compile mutt with the <em/--with-sasl/ flag.
<p>
Mutt will try whichever methods are compiled in and available on the server,
in the following order: SASL, ANONYMOUS, GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, LOGIN.

There are a few variables which control authentication: 
<itemize>
<item><ref id="imap&lowbar;user" name="&dollar;imap&lowbar;user"> - controls
  the username under which you request authentication on the IMAP server,
  for all authenticators. This is overridden by an explicit username in
  the mailbox path (ie by using a mailbox name of the form
  <tt/{user@host}/).
<item><ref id="imap&lowbar;pass" name="&dollar;imap&lowbar;pass"> - a
  password which you may preset, used by all authentication methods where
  a password is needed.
<item><ref id="imap&lowbar;authenticators"
  name="&dollar;imap&lowbar;authenticators"> - a colon-delimited list of IMAP
  authentication methods to try, in the order you wish to try them. If
  specified, this overrides mutt's default (attempt everything, in the order
  listed above).
</itemize>

<sect1>Managing multiple IMAP/POP accounts (OPTIONAL)<label id="account-hook">
<p>

If you happen to have accounts on multiple IMAP and/or POP servers,
you may find managing all the authentication settings inconvenient and
error-prone.  The account-hook command may help. This hook works like
folder-hook but is invoked whenever you access a remote mailbox
(including inside the folder browser), not just when you open the
mailbox.
<p>
Some examples:

<tscreen><verb>
account-hook . 'unset imap_user; unset imap_pass; unset tunnel'
account-hook imap://host1/ 'set imap_user=me1 imap_pass=foo'
account-hook imap://host2/ 'set tunnel="ssh host2 /usr/libexec/imapd"'
</verb></tscreen>

<sect1>Start a WWW Browser on URLs (EXTERNAL)<label id="urlview">
<p>
If a message contains URLs (<em/unified ressource locator/ = address in the
WWW space like <em>http://www.mutt.org/</em>), it is efficient to get
a menu with all the URLs and start a WWW browser on one of them.  This
functionality is provided by the external urlview program which can be
retrieved at <htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.mutt.org/mutt/contrib/"
name="ftp://ftp.mutt.org/mutt/contrib/"> and the configuration commands:
<tscreen><verb>
macro index \cb |urlview\n
macro pager \cb |urlview\n
</verb></tscreen>

<sect>Mutt's MIME Support
<p>
Quite a bit of effort has been made to make Mutt the premier text-mode
MIME MUA.  Every effort has been made to provide the functionality that
the discerning MIME user requires, and the conformance to the standards
wherever possible.  When configuring Mutt for MIME, there are two extra
types of configuration files which Mutt uses.  One is the
<tt/mime.types/ file, which contains the mapping of file extensions to 
IANA MIME types.  The other is the <tt/mailcap/ file, which specifies
the external commands to use for handling specific MIME types.

<sect1>Using MIME in Mutt
<p>
There are three areas/menus in Mutt which deal with MIME, they are the
pager (while viewing a message), the attachment menu and the compose
menu.

<sect2>Viewing MIME messages in the pager
<p>
When you select a message from the index and view it in the pager, Mutt
decodes the message to a text representation.  Mutt internally supports
a number of MIME types, including <tt>text/plain, text/enriched,
message/rfc822, and message/news</tt>.  In addition, the export
controlled version of Mutt recognizes a variety of PGP MIME types,
including PGP/MIME and application/pgp.

Mutt will denote attachments with a couple lines describing them.
These lines are of the form:
<tscreen><verb>
[-- Attachment #1: Description --]
[-- Type: text/plain, Encoding: 7bit, Size: 10000 --]
</verb></tscreen>
Where the <tt/Description/ is the description or filename given for the
attachment, and the <tt/Encoding/ is one of
<tt>7bit/8bit/quoted-printable/base64/binary</tt>.

If Mutt cannot deal with a MIME type, it will display a message like:
<tscreen><verb>
[-- image/gif is unsupported (use 'v' to view this part) --]
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>The Attachment Menu<label id="attach_menu">
<p>
The default binding for <tt/view-attachments/ is `v', which displays the
attachment menu for a message.  The attachment menu displays a list of
the attachments in a message.  From the attachment menu, you can save,
print, pipe, delete, and view attachments.  You can apply these
operations to a group of attachments at once, by tagging the attachments
and by using the ``tag-prefix'' operator.  You can also reply to the
current message from this menu, and only the current attachment (or the
attachments tagged) will be quoted in your reply.  You can view
attachments as text, or view them using the mailcap viewer definition.

Finally, you can apply the usual message-related functions (like 
<ref id="resend-message" name="resend-message">, and the reply
and forward functions) to attachments of type <tt>message/rfc822</tt>.

See the help on the attachment menu for more information.

<sect2>The Compose Menu<label id="compose_menu">
<p>
The compose menu is the menu you see before you send a message.  It
allows you to edit the recipient list, the subject, and other aspects
of your message.  It also contains a list of the attachments of your
message, including the main body.  From this menu, you can print, copy,
filter, pipe, edit, compose, review, and rename an attachment or a
list of tagged attachments.  You can also modifying the attachment
information, notably the type, encoding and description.

Attachments appear as follows:
<verb>
-   1 [text/plain, 7bit, 1K]             /tmp/mutt-euler-8082-0 <no description>
    2 [applica/x-gunzip, base64, 422K]   ~/src/mutt-0.85.tar.gz <no description>
</verb>

The '-' denotes that Mutt will delete the file after sending (or
postponing, or cancelling) the message.  It can be toggled with the
<tt/toggle-unlink/ command (default: u).  The next field is the MIME
content-type, and can be changed with the <tt/edit-type/ command
(default: ^T).  The next field is the encoding for the attachment,
which allows a binary message to be encoded for transmission on 7bit
links.  It can be changed with the <tt/edit-encoding/ command
(default: ^E).  The next field is the size of the attachment,
rounded to kilobytes or megabytes.  The next field is the filename,
which can be changed with the <tt/rename-file/ command (default: R).
The final field is the description of the attachment, and can be
changed with the <tt/edit-description/ command (default: d).

<sect1>MIME Type configuration with <tt/mime.types/
<p>
When you add an attachment to your mail message, Mutt searches your
personal mime.types file at <tt>&dollar;{HOME}/.mime.types</tt>, and then
the system mime.types file at <tt>/usr/local/share/mutt/mime.types</tt> or
<tt>/etc/mime.types</tt>

The mime.types file consist of lines containing a MIME type and a space
separated list of extensions.  For example:
<tscreen><verb>
application/postscript          ps eps
application/pgp                 pgp
audio/x-aiff                    aif aifc aiff
</verb></tscreen>
A sample <tt/mime.types/ file comes with the Mutt distribution, and
should contain most of the MIME types you are likely to use.  

If Mutt can not determine the mime type by the extension of the file you
attach, it will look at the file.  If the file is free of binary
information, Mutt will assume that the file is plain text, and mark it
as <tt>text/plain</tt>.  If the file contains binary information, then Mutt will
mark it as <tt>application/octet-stream</tt>.  You can change the MIME
type that Mutt assigns to an attachment by using the <tt/edit-type/
command from the compose menu (default: ^T). The MIME type is actually a
major mime type followed by the sub-type, separated by a '/'. 6 major
types: application, text, image, video, audio, and model have been approved
after various internet discussions. Mutt recognises all of these if the 
appropriate entry is found in the mime.types file. It also recognises other
major mime types, such as the chemical type that is widely used in the 
molecular modelling community to pass molecular data in various forms to 
various molecular viewers. Non-recognised mime types should only be used 
if the recipient of the message is likely to be expecting such attachments.

<sect1>MIME Viewer configuration with <tt/mailcap/
<p>
Mutt supports RFC 1524 MIME Configuration, in particular the Unix
specific format specified in Appendix A of RFC 1524.  This file format
is commonly referred to as the mailcap format.  Many MIME compliant
programs utilize the mailcap format, allowing you to specify handling
for all MIME types in one place for all programs.  Programs known to
use this format include Netscape, XMosaic, lynx and metamail.

In order to handle various MIME types that Mutt can not handle
internally, Mutt parses a series of external configuration files to
find an external handler.  The default search string for these files
is a colon delimited list set to
<tscreen><verb>
${HOME}/.mailcap:/usr/local/share/mutt/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap
</verb></tscreen>
where <tt/&dollar;HOME/ is your home directory.

In particular, the metamail distribution will install a mailcap file,
usually as <tt>/usr/local/etc/mailcap</tt>, which contains some baseline
entries.

<sect2>The Basics of the mailcap file
<p>
A mailcap file consists of a series of lines which are comments, blank,
or definitions.

A comment line consists of a &num; character followed by anything you want.

A blank line is blank.

A definition line consists of a content type, a view command, and any
number of optional fields.  Each field of a definition line is divided
by a semicolon ';' character.

The content type is specified in the MIME standard type/subtype method.
For example,
<tt>text/plain, text/html, image/gif, </tt>
etc.  In addition, the mailcap format includes two formats for
wildcards, one using the special '*' subtype, the other is the implicit
wild, where you only include the major type.  For example, <tt>image/*</tt>, or
<tt>video,</tt> will match all image types and video types,
respectively.

The view command is a Unix command for viewing the type specified. There
are two different types of commands supported. The default is to send
the body of the MIME message to the command on stdin. You can change
this behaviour by using &percnt;s as a parameter to your view command.
This will cause Mutt to save the body of the MIME message to a temporary
file, and then call the view command with the &percnt;s replaced by
the name of the temporary file. In both cases, Mutt will turn over the
terminal to the view program until the program quits, at which time Mutt
will remove the temporary file if it exists.

So, in the simplest form, you can send a text/plain message to the
external pager more on stdin:
<tscreen><verb>
text/plain; more
</verb></tscreen>
Or, you could send the message as a file:
<tscreen><verb>
text/plain; more %s
</verb></tscreen>
Perhaps you would like to use lynx to interactively view a text/html 
message:
<tscreen><verb>
text/html; lynx %s
</verb></tscreen>
In this case, lynx does not support viewing a file from stdin, so you
must use the &percnt;s syntax.
<bf/Note:/ <em>Some older versions of lynx contain a bug where they
will check the mailcap file for a viewer for text/html.  They will find
the line which calls lynx, and run it.  This causes lynx to continuously
spawn itself to view the object.</em>

On the other hand, maybe you don't want to use lynx interactively, you
just want to have it convert the text/html to text/plain, then you can
use:
<tscreen><verb>
text/html; lynx -dump %s | more
</verb></tscreen>

Perhaps you wish to use lynx to view text/html files, and a pager on
all other text formats, then you would use the following:
<tscreen><verb>
text/html; lynx %s
text/*; more
</verb></tscreen>
This is the simplest form of a mailcap file.

<sect2>Secure use of mailcap
<p>
The interpretion of shell meta-characters embedded in MIME parameters
can lead to security problems in general.  Mutt tries to quote parameters
in expansion of %s syntaxes properly, and avoids risky characters by
substituting them, see the <ref id="mailcap_sanitize"
name="mailcap&lowbar;sanitize"> variable.

Although mutt's procedures to invoke programs with mailcap seem to be
safe, there are other applications parsing mailcap, maybe taking less care
of it.  Therefore you should pay attention to the following rules:

<em/Keep the %-expandos away from shell quoting./
Don't quote them with single or double quotes.  Mutt does this for
you, the right way, as should any other program which interprets
mailcap.  Don't put them into backtick expansions.  Be highly careful
with eval statements, and avoid them if possible at all.  Trying to fix
broken behaviour with quotes introduces new leaks - there is no
alternative to correct quoting in the first place.

If you have to use the %-expandos' values in context where you need
quoting or backtick expansions, put that value into a shell variable
and reference the shell variable where necessary, as in the following
example (using <tt/&dollar;charset/ inside the backtick expansion is safe,
since it is not itself subject to any further expansion):

<tscreen><verb>
text/test-mailcap-bug; cat %s; copiousoutput; test=charset=%{charset} \
        && test "`echo $charset | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`" != iso-8859-1
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>Advanced mailcap Usage
<p>

<sect3>Optional Fields
<p>
In addition to the required content-type and view command fields, you
can add semi-colon ';' separated fields to set flags and other options.
Mutt recognizes the following optional fields:
<descrip>
<tag/copiousoutput/
This flag tells Mutt that the command passes possibly large amounts of
text on stdout.  This causes Mutt to invoke a pager (either the internal
pager or the external pager defined by the pager variable) on the output
of the view command.  Without this flag, Mutt assumes that the command
is interactive.  One could use this to replace the pipe to <tt>more</tt>
in the <tt>lynx -dump</tt> example in the Basic section:
<tscreen><verb>
text/html; lynx -dump %s ; copiousoutput
</verb></tscreen>
This will cause lynx to format the text/html output as text/plain
and Mutt will use your standard pager to display the results.
<tag/needsterminal/
Mutt uses this flag when viewing attachments with <ref id="auto_view"
name="autoview">, in order to decide whether it should honor the setting
of the <ref id="wait_key" name="&dollar;wait&lowbar;key"> variable or
not.  When an attachment is viewed using an interactive program, and the
corresponding mailcap entry has a <em/needsterminal/ flag, Mutt will use
<ref id="wait_key" name="&dollar;wait&lowbar;key"> and the exit status
of the program to decide if it will ask you to press a key after the
external program has exited.  In all other situations it will not prompt
you for a key.
<tag>compose=&lt;command&gt;</tag>
This flag specifies the command to use to create a new attachment of a
specific MIME type.  Mutt supports this from the compose menu.
<tag>composetyped=&lt;command&gt;</tag>
This flag specifies the command to use to create a new attachment of a
specific MIME type.  This command differs from the compose command in
that mutt will expect standard MIME headers on the data.  This can be
used to specify parameters, filename, description, etc. for a new
attachment.   Mutt supports this from the compose menu.
<tag>print=&lt;command&gt;</tag>
This flag specifies the command to use to print a specific MIME type.
Mutt supports this from the attachment and compose menus.
<tag>edit=&lt;command&gt;</tag>
This flag specifies the command to use to edit a specific MIME type.  
Mutt supports this from the compose menu, and also uses it to compose
new attachments.  Mutt will default to the defined editor for text
attachments.
<tag>nametemplate=&lt;template&gt;</tag>
This field specifies the format for the file denoted by &percnt;s in the
command fields.  Certain programs will require a certain file extension,
for instance, to correctly view a file.  For instance, lynx will only
interpret a file as <tt>text/html</tt> if the file ends in <tt/.html/.
So, you would specify lynx as a <tt>text/html</tt> viewer with a line in
the mailcap file like:
<tscreen><verb>
text/html; lynx %s; nametemplate=%s.html
</verb></tscreen>
<tag>test=&lt;command&gt;</tag>
This field specifies a command to run to test whether this mailcap
entry should be used.  The command is defined with the command expansion
rules defined in the next section.  If the command returns 0, then the
test passed, and Mutt uses this entry.  If the command returns non-zero,
then the test failed, and Mutt continues searching for the right entry.
<bf/Note:/ <em>the content-type must match before Mutt performs the test.</em>
For example:
<tscreen><verb>
text/html; netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)' ; test=RunningX
text/html; lynx %s
</verb></tscreen>
In this example, Mutt will run the program RunningX which will return 0
if the X Window manager is running, and non-zero if it isn't.  If
RunningX returns 0, then Mutt will call netscape to display the
text/html object.  If RunningX doesn't return 0, then Mutt will go on
to the next entry and use lynx to display the text/html object.
</descrip>

<sect3>Search Order
<p>
When searching for an entry in the mailcap file, Mutt will search for
the most useful entry for its purpose.  For instance, if you are
attempting to print an <tt>image/gif</tt>, and you have the following
entries in your mailcap file, Mutt will search for an entry with the
print command:
<tscreen><verb>
image/*;        xv %s
image/gif;      ; print= anytopnm %s | pnmtops | lpr; \
                nametemplate=%s.gif
</verb></tscreen>
Mutt will skip the <tt>image/*</tt> entry and use the <tt>image/gif</tt>
entry with the print command.

In addition, you can use this with <ref id="auto_view" name="Autoview"> 
to denote two commands for viewing an attachment, one to be viewed
automatically, the other to be viewed interactively from the attachment
menu.  In addition, you can then use the test feature to determine which
viewer to use interactively depending on your environment.
<tscreen><verb>
text/html;      netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)' ; test=RunningX
text/html;      lynx %s; nametemplate=%s.html
text/html;      lynx -dump %s; nametemplate=%s.html; copiousoutput
</verb></tscreen>
For <ref id="auto_view" name="Autoview">, Mutt will choose the third
entry because of the copiousoutput tag.  For interactive viewing, Mutt
will run the program RunningX to determine if it should use the first
entry.  If the program returns non-zero, Mutt will use the second entry
for interactive viewing.

<sect3>Command Expansion
<p>
The various commands defined in the mailcap files are passed to the
<tt>/bin/sh</tt> shell using the system() function.  Before the
command is passed to <tt>/bin/sh -c</tt>, it is parsed to expand
various special parameters with information from Mutt.  The keywords
Mutt expands are:
<descrip>
<tag/&percnt;s/
As seen in the basic mailcap section, this variable is expanded
to a filename specified by the calling program.  This file contains
the body of the message to view/print/edit or where the composing
program should place the results of composition.  In addition, the
use of this keyword causes Mutt to not pass the body of the message
to the view/print/edit program on stdin.
<tag/&percnt;t/
Mutt will expand &percnt;t to the text representation of the content
type of the message in the same form as the first parameter of the
mailcap definition line, ie <tt>text/html</tt> or
<tt>image/gif</tt>.
<tag>&percnt;{&lt;parameter&gt;}</tag>
Mutt will expand this to the value of the specified parameter
from the Content-Type: line of the mail message.  For instance, if
Your mail message contains:
<tscreen><verb>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1
</verb></tscreen>
then Mutt will expand &percnt;{charset} to iso-8859-1.  The default metamail
mailcap file uses this feature to test the charset to spawn an xterm
using the right charset to view the message.
<tag>&bsol;&percnt;</tag>
This will be replaced by a &percnt;
</descrip>
Mutt does not currently support the &percnt;F and &percnt;n keywords
specified in RFC 1524.  The main purpose of these parameters is for
multipart messages, which is handled internally by Mutt.

<sect2>Example mailcap files
<p>
This mailcap file is fairly simple and standard:
<code>
# I'm always running X :)
video/*;        xanim %s > /dev/null
image/*;        xv %s > /dev/null

# I'm always running netscape (if my computer had more memory, maybe)
text/html;      netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)'
</code>

This mailcap file shows quite a number of examples:

<code>
# Use xanim to view all videos   Xanim produces a header on startup,
# send that to /dev/null so I don't see it
video/*;        xanim %s > /dev/null

# Send html to a running netscape by remote
text/html;      netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)'; test=RunningNetscape

# If I'm not running netscape but I am running X, start netscape on the
# object
text/html;      netscape %s; test=RunningX

# Else use lynx to view it as text
text/html;      lynx %s

# This version would convert the text/html to text/plain
text/html;      lynx -dump %s; copiousoutput

# I use enscript to print text in two columns to a page
text/*;         more %s; print=enscript -2Gr %s

# Netscape adds a flag to tell itself to view jpegs internally
image/jpeg;xv %s; x-mozilla-flags=internal

# Use xv to view images if I'm running X
# In addition, this uses the \ to extend the line and set my editor
# for images
image/*;xv %s; test=RunningX; \
        edit=xpaint %s

# Convert images to text using the netpbm tools
image/*;  (anytopnm %s | pnmscale -xysize 80 46 | ppmtopgm | pgmtopbm |
pbmtoascii -1x2 ) 2>&1 ; copiousoutput

# Send excel spreadsheets to my NT box
application/ms-excel; open.pl %s
</code>

<sect1>MIME Autoview<label id="auto_view">
<p>
In addition to explicitly telling Mutt to view an attachment with the
MIME viewer defined in the mailcap file, Mutt has support for
automatically viewing MIME attachments while in the pager.

To work, you must define a viewer in the mailcap file which uses the 
<tt/copiousoutput/ option to denote that it is non-interactive.
Usually, you also use the entry to convert the attachment to a text
representation which you can view in the pager.

You then use the <tt/auto&lowbar;view/ muttrc command to list the
content-types that you wish to view automatically.

For instance, if you set auto&lowbar;view to:
<tscreen><verb>
auto_view text/html application/x-gunzip application/postscript image/gif application/x-tar-gz
</verb></tscreen>

Mutt could use the following mailcap entries to automatically view
attachments of these types.
<tscreen><verb>
text/html;      lynx -dump %s; copiousoutput; nametemplate=%s.html
image/*;        anytopnm %s | pnmscale -xsize 80 -ysize 50 | ppmtopgm | pgmtopbm | pbmtoascii ; copiousoutput
application/x-gunzip;   gzcat; copiousoutput
application/x-tar-gz; gunzip -c %s | tar -tf - ; copiousoutput
application/postscript; ps2ascii %s; copiousoutput
</verb></tscreen>

``unauto_view'' can be used to remove previous entries from the autoview list.
This can be used with message-hook to autoview messages based on size, etc.
``unauto_view *'' will remove all previous entries.

<sect1>MIME Multipart/Alternative<label id="alternative_order">
<p>
Mutt has some heuristics for determining which attachment of a
multipart/alternative type to display.  First, mutt will check the 
alternative&lowbar;order list to determine if one of the available types
is preferred.  The alternative&lowbar;order list consists of a number of
mimetypes in order, including support for implicit and explicit
wildcards, for example:
<tscreen><verb>
alternative_order text/enriched text/plain text application/postscript image/*
</verb></tscreen>

Next, mutt will check if any of the types have a defined 
<ref id="auto_view" name="auto&lowbar;view">, and use that.  Failing
that, Mutt will look for any text type.  As a last attempt, mutt will
look for any type it knows how to handle.

To remove a MIME type from the <tt/alternative_order/ list, use the
<tt/unalternative_order/ command.

<sect1>MIME Lookup<label id="mime_lookup">
<p>
Mutt's mime&lowbar;lookup list specifies a list of mime-types that should not
be treated according to their mailcap entry.  This option is designed to
deal with binary types such as application/octet-stream.  When an attachment's
mime-type is listed in mime&lowbar;lookup, then the extension of the filename will
be compared to the list of extensions in the mime.types file.  The mime-type
associated with this extension will then be used to process the attachment
according to the rules in the mailcap file and according to any other configuration
options (such as auto&lowbar;view) specified.  Common usage would be:
<tscreen><verb>
mime-lookup application/octet-stream application/X-Lotus-Manuscript
</verb></tscreen>

In addition, the unmime&lowbar;lookup command may be used to disable this feature
for any particular mime-type if it had been set, for example, in a global
muttrc.

<sect>Reference
<sect1>Command line options<label id="commandline">
<p>
Running <tt/mutt/ with no arguments will make Mutt attempt to read your spool
mailbox.  However, it is possible to read other mailboxes and
to send messages from the command line as well.

<tscreen><verb>

</verb></tscreen>

To read messages in a mailbox

<tt/mutt/ &lsqb; -nz &rsqb; &lsqb; -F <em/muttrc/ &rsqb; &lsqb; -m <em/type/ &rsqb; &lsqb; -f <em/mailbox/ &rsqb; 

To compose a new message

<tt/mutt/ &lsqb; -n &rsqb; &lsqb; -F <em/muttrc/ &rsqb; &lsqb; -a <em/file/ &rsqb; &lsqb; -c <em/address/ &rsqb; &lsqb; -i <em/filename/ &rsqb; &lsqb; -s <em/subject/ &rsqb; <em/address/ &lsqb; <em/address/ ... &rsqb; 

Mutt also supports a ``batch'' mode to send prepared messages.  Simply redirect
input from the file you wish to send.  For example,

<tt>mutt -s &dquot;data set for run &num;2&dquot; professor@bigschool.edu
&lt; &tilde;/run2.dat</tt>

This command will send a message to ``professor@bigschool.edu'' with a subject
of ``data set for run &num;2''.  In the body of the message will be the contents
of the file ``&tilde;/run2.dat''.

<sect1>Configuration variables<label id="variables">
<p>


<sect2>abort&lowbar;nosubject<label id="abort_nosubject">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-yes

<p>
If set to <em>yes</em>, when composing messages and no subject is given
at the subject prompt, composition will be aborted.  If set to
<em>no</em>, composing messages with no subject given at the subject
prompt will never be aborted.


<sect2>abort&lowbar;unmodified<label id="abort_unmodified">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If set to <em>yes</em>, composition will automatically abort after
editing the message body if no changes are made to the file (this
check only happens after the <em>first</em> edit of the file).  When set
to <em>no</em>, composition will never be aborted.


<sect2>alias&lowbar;file<label id="alias_file">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&tilde;/.muttrc&dquot;

<p>
The default file in which to save aliases created by the 
``<ref id="create-alias" name="create-alias">'' function.
<p>
<bf>Note:</bf> Mutt will not automatically source this file; you must
explicitly use the ``<ref id="source" name="source">'' command for it to be executed.


<sect2>alias&lowbar;format<label id="alias_format">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&percnt;4n &percnt;2f &percnt;t &percnt;-10a   &percnt;r&dquot;

<p>
Specifies the format of the data displayed for the `alias' menu.  The
following printf(3)-style sequences are available:
<p>

<descrip>
<tag>&percnt;a </tag>alias name
<tag>&percnt;f </tag>flags - currently, a &dquot;d&dquot; for an alias marked for deletion
<tag>&percnt;n </tag>index number
<tag>&percnt;r </tag>address which alias expands to
<tag>&percnt;t </tag>character which indicates if the alias is tagged for inclusion
</descrip>


<sect2>allow&lowbar;8bit<label id="allow_8bit">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
Controls whether 8-bit data is converted to 7-bit using either Quoted-
Printable or Base64 encoding when sending mail.


<sect2>allow&lowbar;ansi<label id="allow_ansi">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
Controls whether ANSI color codes in messages (and color tags in 
rich text messages) are to be interpreted.
Messages containing these codes are rare, but if this option is set,
their text will be colored accordingly. Note that this may override
your color choices, and even present a security problem, since a
message could include a line like &dquot;&lsqb;-- PGP output follows ...&dquot; and
give it the same color as your attachment color.


<sect2>arrow&lowbar;cursor<label id="arrow_cursor">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set, an arrow (``-&gt;'') will be used to indicate the current entry
in menus instead of highlighting the whole line.  On slow network or modem
links this will make response faster because there is less that has to
be redrawn on the screen when moving to the next or previous entries
in the menu.


<sect2>ascii&lowbar;chars<label id="ascii_chars">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, Mutt will use plain ASCII characters when displaying thread
and attachment trees, instead of the default <em>ACS</em> characters.


<sect2>askbcc<label id="askbcc">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, Mutt will prompt you for blind-carbon-copy (Bcc) recipients
before editing an outgoing message.


<sect2>askcc<label id="askcc">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, Mutt will prompt you for carbon-copy (Cc) recipients before
editing the body of an outgoing message.


<sect2>ask&lowbar;follow&lowbar;up<label id="ask_follow_up">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, Mutt will prompt you for follow-up groups before editing
the body of an outgoing message.


<sect2>ask&lowbar;x&lowbar;comment&lowbar;to<label id="ask_x_comment_to">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, Mutt will prompt you for x-comment-to field before editing
the body of an outgoing message.


<sect2>attach&lowbar;format<label id="attach_format">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&percnt;u&percnt;D&percnt;I &percnt;t&percnt;4n &percnt;T&percnt;.40d&percnt;&gt; &lsqb;&percnt;.7m/&percnt;.10M, &percnt;.6e&percnt;?C?, &percnt;C?, &percnt;s&rsqb; &dquot;

<p>
This variable describes the format of the `attachment' menu.  The
following printf-style sequences are understood:
<p>

<descrip>
<tag>&percnt;C  </tag>charset
<tag>&percnt;c  </tag>reqiures charset conversion (n or c)
<tag>&percnt;D  </tag>deleted flag
<tag>&percnt;d  </tag>description
<tag>&percnt;e  </tag>MIME content-transfer-encoding
<tag>&percnt;f  </tag>filename
<tag>&percnt;I  </tag>disposition (I=inline, A=attachment)
<tag>&percnt;m  </tag>major MIME type
<tag>&percnt;M  </tag>MIME subtype
<tag>&percnt;n  </tag>attachment number
<tag>&percnt;s  </tag>size
<tag>&percnt;t  </tag>tagged flag
<tag>&percnt;T  </tag>graphic tree characters
<tag>&percnt;u  </tag>unlink (=to delete) flag
<tag>&percnt;&gt;X </tag>right justify the rest of the string and pad with character &dquot;X&dquot;
<tag>&percnt;|X </tag>pad to the end of the line with character &dquot;X&dquot;
</descrip>


<sect2>attach&lowbar;sep<label id="attach_sep">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&bsol;n&dquot;

<p>
The separator to add between attachments when operating (saving,
printing, piping, etc) on a list of tagged attachments.


<sect2>attach&lowbar;split<label id="attach_split">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If this variable is unset, when operating (saving, printing, piping,
etc) on a list of tagged attachments, Mutt will concatenate the
attachments and will operate on them as a single attachment. The
``<ref id="attach_sep" name="&dollar;attach&lowbar;sep">'' separator is added after each attachment. When set,
Mutt will operate on the attachments one by one.


<sect2>attribution<label id="attribution">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;On &percnt;d, &percnt;n wrote:&dquot;

<p>
This is the string that will precede a message which has been included
in a reply.  For a full listing of defined printf()-like sequences see
the section on ``<ref id="index_format" name="&dollar;index&lowbar;format">''.


<sect2>autoedit<label id="autoedit">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set along with ``<ref id="edit_headers" name="&dollar;edit&lowbar;headers">'', Mutt will skip the initial
send-menu and allow you to immediately begin editing the body of your
message.  The send-menu may still be accessed once you have finished
editing the body of your message.
<p>
Also see ``<ref id="fast_reply" name="&dollar;fast&lowbar;reply">''.


<sect2>auto&lowbar;tag<label id="auto_tag">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set, functions in the <em>index</em> menu which affect a message
will be applied to all tagged messages (if there are any).  When
unset, you must first use the tag-prefix function (default: &dquot;;&dquot;) to
make the next function apply to all tagged messages.


<sect2>beep<label id="beep">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When this variable is set, mutt will beep when an error occurs.


<sect2>beep&lowbar;new<label id="beep_new">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When this variable is set, mutt will beep whenever it prints a message
notifying you of new mail.  This is independent of the setting of the
``<ref id="beep" name="&dollar;beep">'' variable.


<sect2>bounce<label id="bounce">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-yes

<p>
Controls whether you will be asked to confirm bouncing messages.
If set to <em>yes</em> you don't get asked if you want to bounce a
message. Setting this variable to <em>no</em> is not generally useful,
and thus not recommended, because you are unable to bounce messages.


<sect2>bounce&lowbar;delivered<label id="bounce_delivered">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When this variable is set, mutt will include Delivered-To headers when
bouncing messages.  Postfix users may wish to unset this variable.


<sect2>catchup&lowbar;newsgroup<label id="catchup_newsgroup">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-yes

<p>
If this variable is <em>set</em>, Mutt will mark all articles in newsgroup
as read when you quit the newsgroup (catchup newsgroup).


<sect2>charset<label id="charset">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Character set your terminal uses to display and enter textual data.


<sect2>check&lowbar;new<label id="check_new">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
<bf>Note:</bf> this option only affects <em>maildir</em> and <em>MH</em> style
mailboxes.
<p>
When <em>set</em>, Mutt will check for new mail delivered while the
mailbox is open.  Especially with MH mailboxes, this operation can
take quite some time since it involves scanning the directory and
checking each file to see if it has already been looked at.  If
<em>check&lowbar;new</em> is <em>unset</em>, no check for new mail is performed
while the mailbox is open.


<sect2>collapse&lowbar;unread<label id="collapse_unread">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When <em>unset</em>, Mutt will not collapse a thread if it contains any
unread messages.


<sect2>uncollapse&lowbar;jump<label id="uncollapse_jump">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When <em>set</em>, Mutt will jump to the next unread message, if any,
when the current thread is <em>un</em>collapsed.


<sect2>compose&lowbar;format<label id="compose_format">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;-- Mutt: Compose  &lsqb;Approx. msg size: &percnt;l   Atts: &percnt;a&rsqb;&percnt;&gt;-&dquot;

<p>
Controls the format of the status line displayed in the &bsol;fCompose
menu.  This string is similar to ``<ref id="status_format" name="&dollar;status&lowbar;format">'', but has its own
set of printf()-like sequences:
<p>

<descrip>
<tag>&percnt;a </tag>total number of attachments 
<tag>&percnt;h </tag>local hostname
<tag>&percnt;l </tag>approximate size (in bytes) of the current message
<tag>&percnt;v </tag>Mutt version string
</descrip>

<p>
See the text describing the ``<ref id="status_format" name="&dollar;status&lowbar;format">'' option for more 
information on how to set ``<ref id="compose_format" name="&dollar;compose&lowbar;format">''.


<sect2>confirmappend<label id="confirmappend">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When set, Mutt will prompt for confirmation when appending messages to
an existing mailbox.


<sect2>confirmcreate<label id="confirmcreate">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When set, Mutt will prompt for confirmation when saving messages to a
mailbox which does not yet exist before creating it.


<sect2>connect&lowbar;timeout<label id="connect_timeout">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 30

<p>
Causes Mutt to timeout a network connection (for IMAP or POP) after this
many seconds if the connection is not able to be established.  A negative
value causes Mutt to wait indefinitely for the connection to succeed.


<sect2>content&lowbar;type<label id="content_type">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;text/plain&dquot;

<p>
Sets the default Content-Type for the body of newly composed messages.


<sect2>copy<label id="copy">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
This variable controls whether or not copies of your outgoing messages
will be saved for later references.  Also see ``<ref id="record" name="&dollar;record">'',
``<ref id="save_name" name="&dollar;save&lowbar;name">'', ``<ref id="force_name" name="&dollar;force&lowbar;name">'' and ``<ref id="fcc-hook" name="fcc-hook">''.


<sect2>crypt&lowbar;autopgp<label id="crypt_autopgp">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
This variable controls whether or not mutt may automatically enable
PGP encryption/signing for messages.  See also ``<ref id="crypt_autoencrypt" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;autoencrypt">'',
``<ref id="crypt_replyencrypt" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;replyencrypt">'',
``<ref id="crypt_autosign" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;autosign">'', ``<ref id="crypt_replysign" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;replysign">'' and ``<ref id="smime_is_default" name="&dollar;smime&lowbar;is&lowbar;default">''.


<sect2>crypt&lowbar;autosmime<label id="crypt_autosmime">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
This variable controls whether or not mutt may automatically enable
S/MIME encryption/signing for messages. See also ``<ref id="crypt_autoencrypt" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;autoencrypt">'',
``<ref id="crypt_replyencrypt" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;replyencrypt">'',
``<ref id="crypt_autosign" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;autosign">'', ``<ref id="crypt_replysign" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;replysign">'' and ``<ref id="smime_is_default" name="&dollar;smime&lowbar;is&lowbar;default">''.


<sect2>date&lowbar;format<label id="date_format">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;!&percnt;a, &percnt;b &percnt;d, &percnt;Y at &percnt;I:&percnt;M:&percnt;S&percnt;p &percnt;Z&dquot;

<p>
This variable controls the format of the date printed by the ``&percnt;d''
sequence in ``<ref id="index_format" name="&dollar;index&lowbar;format">''.  This is passed to the <em>strftime</em>
call to process the date. See the man page for <em>strftime(3)</em> for
the proper syntax.
<p>
Unless the first character in the string is a bang (``!''), the month
and week day names are expanded according to the locale specified in
the variable ``<ref id="locale" name="&dollar;locale">''. If the first character in the string is a
bang, the bang is discarded, and the month and week day names in the
rest of the string are expanded in the <em>C</em> locale (that is in US
English).


<sect2>default&lowbar;hook<label id="default_hook">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&tilde;f &percnt;s !&tilde;P | (&tilde;P &tilde;C &percnt;s)&dquot;

<p>
This variable controls how send-hooks, message-hooks, save-hooks,
and fcc-hooks will
be interpreted if they are specified with only a simple regexp,
instead of a matching pattern.  The hooks are expanded when they are
declared, so a hook will be interpreted according to the value of this
variable at the time the hook is declared.  The default value matches
if the message is either from a user matching the regular expression
given, or if it is from you (if the from address matches
``alternates'') and is to or cc'ed to a user matching the given
regular expression.


<sect2>delete<label id="delete">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-yes

<p>
Controls whether or not messages are really deleted when closing or
synchronizing a mailbox.  If set to <em>yes</em>, messages marked for
deleting will automatically be purged without prompting.  If set to
<em>no</em>, messages marked for deletion will be kept in the mailbox.


<sect2>delete&lowbar;untag<label id="delete_untag">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If this option is <em>set</em>, mutt will untag messages when marking them
for deletion.  This applies when you either explicitly delete a message,
or when you save it to another folder.


<sect2>digest&lowbar;collapse<label id="digest_collapse">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If this option is <em>set</em>, mutt's revattach menu will not show the subparts of
individual messages in a digest.  To see these subparts, press 'v' on that menu.


<sect2>display&lowbar;filter<label id="display_filter">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
When set, specifies a command used to filter messages.  When a message
is viewed it is passed as standard input to <ref id="display_filter" name="&dollar;display&lowbar;filter">, and the
filtered message is read from the standard output.


<sect2>dotlock&lowbar;program<label id="dotlock_program">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;/usr/local/bin/mutt&lowbar;dotlock&dquot;

<p>
Contains the path of the mutt&lowbar;dotlock (8) binary to be used by
mutt.


<sect2>dsn&lowbar;notify<label id="dsn_notify">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
<bf>Note:</bf> you should not enable this unless you are using Sendmail
8.8.x or greater.
<p>
This variable sets the request for when notification is returned.  The
string consists of a comma separated list (no spaces!) of one or more
of the following: <em>never</em>, to never request notification,
<em>failure</em>, to request notification on transmission failure,
<em>delay</em>, to be notified of message delays, <em>success</em>, to be
notified of successful transmission.
<p>
Example: set dsn&lowbar;notify=&dquot;failure,delay&dquot;


<sect2>dsn&lowbar;return<label id="dsn_return">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
<bf>Note:</bf> you should not enable this unless you are using Sendmail
8.8.x or greater.
<p>
This variable controls how much of your message is returned in DSN
messages.  It may be set to either <em>hdrs</em> to return just the
message header, or <em>full</em> to return the full message.
<p>
Example: set dsn&lowbar;return=hdrs


<sect2>duplicate&lowbar;threads<label id="duplicate_threads">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
This variable controls whether mutt, when sorting by threads, threads
messages with the same message-id together.  If it is set, it will indicate
that it thinks they are duplicates of each other with an equals sign
in the thread diagram.


<sect2>edit&lowbar;headers<label id="edit_headers">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
This option allows you to edit the header of your outgoing messages
along with the body of your message.


<sect2>editor<label id="editor">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
This variable specifies which editor is used by mutt.
It defaults to the value of the VISUAL, or EDITOR, environment
variable, or to the string &dquot;vi&dquot; if neither of those are set.


<sect2>encode&lowbar;from<label id="encode_from">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When <em>set</em>, mutt will quoted-printable encode messages when
they contain the string &dquot;From &dquot; in the beginning of a line.
Useful to avoid the tampering certain mail delivery and transport
agents tend to do with messages.


<sect2>envelope&lowbar;from<label id="envelope_from">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When <em>set</em>, mutt will try to derive the message's <em>envelope</em>
sender from the &dquot;From:&dquot; header.  Note that this information is passed 
to sendmail command using the &dquot;-f&dquot; command line switch, so don't set this
option if you are using that switch in <ref id="sendmail" name="&dollar;sendmail"> yourself,
or if the sendmail on your machine doesn't support that command
line switch.


<sect2>escape<label id="escape">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&tilde;&dquot;

<p>
Escape character to use for functions in the builtin editor.


<sect2>fast&lowbar;reply<label id="fast_reply">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set, the initial prompt for recipients and subject are skipped
when replying to messages, and the initial prompt for subject is
skipped when forwarding messages.
<p>
<bf>Note:</bf> this variable has no effect when the ``<ref id="autoedit" name="&dollar;autoedit">''
variable is set.


<sect2>fcc&lowbar;attach<label id="fcc_attach">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
This variable controls whether or not attachments on outgoing messages
are saved along with the main body of your message.


<sect2>fcc&lowbar;clear<label id="fcc_clear">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When this variable is set, FCCs will be stored unencrypted and
unsigned, even when the actual message is encrypted and/or
signed.
(PGP only)


<sect2>folder<label id="folder">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&tilde;/Mail&dquot;

<p>
Specifies the default location of your mailboxes.  A `+' or `=' at the
beginning of a pathname will be expanded to the value of this
variable.  Note that if you change this variable from the default
value you need to make sure that the assignment occurs <em>before</em>
you use `+' or `=' for any other variables since expansion takes place
during the `set' command.


<sect2>folder&lowbar;format<label id="folder_format">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&percnt;2C &percnt;t &percnt;N &percnt;F &percnt;2l &percnt;-8.8u &percnt;-8.8g &percnt;8s &percnt;d &percnt;f&dquot;

<p>
This variable allows you to customize the file browser display to your
personal taste.  This string is similar to ``<ref id="index_format" name="&dollar;index&lowbar;format">'', but has
its own set of printf()-like sequences:
<p>

<descrip>
<tag>&percnt;C  </tag>current file number
<tag>&percnt;d  </tag>date/time folder was last modified
<tag>&percnt;f  </tag>filename

<tag>&percnt;g  </tag>group name (or numeric gid, if missing)
<tag>&percnt;l  </tag>number of hard links
<tag>&percnt;N  </tag>N if folder has new mail, blank otherwise
<tag>&percnt;s  </tag>size in bytes
<tag>&percnt;t  </tag>* if the file is tagged, blank otherwise
<tag>&percnt;u  </tag>owner name (or numeric uid, if missing)
<tag>&percnt;&gt;X </tag>right justify the rest of the string and pad with character &dquot;X&dquot;
<tag>&percnt;|X </tag>pad to the end of the line with character &dquot;X&dquot;
</descrip>


<sect2>followup&lowbar;to<label id="followup_to">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
Controls whether or not the <em>Mail-Followup-To</em> header field is
generated when sending mail.  When <em>set</em>, Mutt will generate this
field when you are replying to a known mailing list, specified with
the ``subscribe'' or ``<ref id="lists" name="lists">'' commands.
<p>
This field has two purposes.  First, preventing you from
receiving duplicate copies of replies to messages which you send
to mailing lists, and second, ensuring that you do get a reply
separately for any messages sent to known lists to which you are
not subscribed.  The header will contain only the list's address
for subscribed lists, and both the list address and your own
email address for unsubscribed lists.  Without this header, a
group reply to your message sent to a subscribed list will be
sent to both the list and your address, resulting in two copies
of the same email for you.


<sect2>followup&lowbar;to&lowbar;poster<label id="followup_to_poster">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-yes

<p>
If this variable is <em>set</em> and the keyword &dquot;poster&dquot; is present in
<em>Followup-To</em> header, follow-up to newsgroup function is not
permitted.  The message will be mailed to the submitter of the
message via mail.


<sect2>force&lowbar;name<label id="force_name">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
This variable is similar to ``<ref id="save_name" name="&dollar;save&lowbar;name">'', except that Mutt will
store a copy of your outgoing message by the username of the address
you are sending to even if that mailbox does not exist.
<p>
Also see the ``<ref id="record" name="&dollar;record">'' variable.


<sect2>forward&lowbar;decode<label id="forward_decode">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into text/plain when
forwarding a message.  The message header is also RFC2047 decoded.
This variable is only used, if ``<ref id="mime_forward" name="&dollar;mime&lowbar;forward">'' is <em>unset</em>,
otherwise ``<ref id="mime_forward_decode" name="&dollar;mime&lowbar;forward&lowbar;decode">'' is used instead.


<sect2>forward&lowbar;edit<label id="forward_edit">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
This quadoption controls whether or not the user is automatically
placed in the editor when forwarding messages.  For those who always want
to forward with no modification, use a setting of ``no''.


<sect2>forward&lowbar;format<label id="forward_format">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&lsqb;&percnt;a: &percnt;s&rsqb;&dquot;

<p>
This variable controls the default subject when forwarding a message.
It uses the same format sequences as the ``<ref id="index_format" name="&dollar;index&lowbar;format">'' variable.


<sect2>forward&lowbar;quote<label id="forward_quote">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When <em>set</em> forwarded messages included in the main body of the
message (when ``<ref id="mime_forward" name="&dollar;mime&lowbar;forward">'' is <em>unset</em>) will be quoted using
``<ref id="indent_string" name="&dollar;indent&lowbar;string">''.


<sect2>from<label id="from">
<p>
Type: e-mail address<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
When set, this variable contains a default from address.  It
can be overridden using my&lowbar;hdr (including from send-hooks) and
``<ref id="reverse_name" name="&dollar;reverse&lowbar;name">''.  This variable is ignored if ``<ref id="use_from" name="&dollar;use&lowbar;from">''
is unset.
<p>
Defaults to the contents of the environment variable EMAIL.


<sect2>gecos&lowbar;mask<label id="gecos_mask">
<p>
Type: regular expression<newline>
Default: &dquot;^&lsqb;^,&rsqb;*&dquot;

<p>
A regular expression used by mutt to parse the GECOS field of a password
entry when expanding the alias.  By default the regular expression is set
to &dquot;^&lsqb;^,&rsqb;*&dquot; which will return the string up to the first &dquot;,&dquot; encountered.
If the GECOS field contains a string like &dquot;lastname, firstname&dquot; then you
should set the gecos&lowbar;mask=&dquot;.*&dquot;.
<p>
This can be useful if you see the following behavior: you address a e-mail
to user ID stevef whose full name is Steve Franklin.  If mutt expands 
stevef to &dquot;Franklin&dquot; stevef@foo.bar then you should set the gecos&lowbar;mask to
a regular expression that will match the whole name so mutt will expand
&dquot;Franklin&dquot; to &dquot;Franklin, Steve&dquot;.


<sect2>group&lowbar;index&lowbar;format<label id="group_index_format">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&percnt;4C &percnt;M&percnt;N &percnt;5s  &percnt;-45.45f &percnt;d&dquot;

<p>
This variable allows you to customize the newsgroup browser display to
your personal taste.  This string is similar to ``<ref id="index_format" name="index&lowbar;format">'', but
has its own set of printf()-like sequences:
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
%C      current newsgroup number
%d      description of newsgroup (becomes from server)
%f      newsgroup name
%M      - if newsgroup not allowed for direct post (moderated for example)
%N      N if newsgroup is new, u if unsubscribed, blank otherwise
%n      number of new articles in newsgroup
%s      number of unread articles in newsgroup
%>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with character "X"
%|X     pad to the end of the line with character "X"

</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>hdrs<label id="hdrs">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When unset, the header fields normally added by the ``<ref id="my_hdr" name="my&lowbar;hdr">''
command are not created.  This variable <em>must</em> be unset before
composing a new message or replying in order to take effect.  If set,
the user defined header fields are added to every new message.


<sect2>header<label id="header">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set, this variable causes Mutt to include the header
of the message you are replying to into the edit buffer.
The ``<ref id="weed" name="&dollar;weed">'' setting applies.


<sect2>help<label id="help">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When set, help lines describing the bindings for the major functions
provided by each menu are displayed on the first line of the screen.
<p>
<bf>Note:</bf> The binding will not be displayed correctly if the
function is bound to a sequence rather than a single keystroke.  Also,
the help line may not be updated if a binding is changed while Mutt is
running.  Since this variable is primarily aimed at new users, neither
of these should present a major problem.


<sect2>hidden&lowbar;host<label id="hidden_host">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set, mutt will skip the host name part of ``<ref id="hostname" name="&dollar;hostname">'' variable
when adding the domain part to addresses.  This variable does not
affect the generation of Message-IDs, and it will not lead to the 
cut-off of first-level domains.


<sect2>hide&lowbar;limited<label id="hide_limited">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set, mutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden
by limiting, in the thread tree.


<sect2>hide&lowbar;missing<label id="hide_missing">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing messages in the
thread tree.


<sect2>hide&lowbar;top&lowbar;limited<label id="hide_top_limited">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set, mutt will not show the presence of messages that are hidden
by limiting, at the top of threads in the thread tree.  Note that when
<ref id="hide_missing" name="&dollar;hide&lowbar;missing"> is set, this option will have no effect.


<sect2>hide&lowbar;top&lowbar;missing<label id="hide_top_missing">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When set, mutt will not show the presence of missing messages at the
top of threads in the thread tree.  Note that when <ref id="hide_limited" name="&dollar;hide&lowbar;limited"> is
set, this option will have no effect.


<sect2>history<label id="history">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 10

<p>
This variable controls the size (in number of strings remembered) of
the string history buffer. The buffer is cleared each time the
variable is set.


<sect2>honor&lowbar;followup&lowbar;to<label id="honor_followup_to">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
This variable controls whether or not a Mail-Followup-To header is
honored when group-replying to a message.


<sect2>hostname<label id="hostname">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Specifies the hostname to use after the ``@'' in local e-mail
addresses.  This overrides the compile time definition obtained from
/etc/resolv.conf.


<sect2>ignore&lowbar;list&lowbar;reply&lowbar;to<label id="ignore_list_reply_to">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
Affects the behaviour of the <em>reply</em> function when replying to
messages from mailing lists.  When set, if the ``Reply-To:'' field is
set to the same value as the ``To:'' field, Mutt assumes that the
``Reply-To:'' field was set by the mailing list to automate responses
to the list, and will ignore this field.  To direct a response to the
mailing list when this option is set, use the <em>list-reply</em>
function; <em>group-reply</em> will reply to both the sender and the
list.


<sect2>imap&lowbar;authenticators<label id="imap_authenticators">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods mutt may
attempt to use to log in to an IMAP server, in the order mutt should
try them.  Authentication methods are either 'login' or the right
side of an IMAP 'AUTH=xxx' capability string, eg 'digest-md5',
'gssapi' or 'cram-md5'. This parameter is case-insensitive. If this
parameter is unset (the default) mutt will try all available methods,
in order from most-secure to least-secure.
<p>
Example: set imap&lowbar;authenticators=&dquot;gssapi:cram-md5:login&dquot;
<p>
<bf>Note:</bf> Mutt will only fall back to other authentication methods if
the previous methods are unavailable. If a method is available but
authentication fails, mutt will not connect to the IMAP server.


<sect2>imap&lowbar;delim&lowbar;chars<label id="imap_delim_chars">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;/.&dquot;

<p>
This contains the list of characters which you would like to treat
as folder separators for displaying IMAP paths. In particular it
helps in using the '=' shortcut for your <em>folder</em> variable.


<sect2>imap&lowbar;force&lowbar;ssl<label id="imap_force_ssl">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If this variable is set, Mutt will always use SSL when
connecting to IMAP servers.


<sect2>imap&lowbar;home&lowbar;namespace<label id="imap_home_namespace">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
You normally want to see your personal folders alongside
your INBOX in the IMAP browser. If you see something else, you may set
this variable to the IMAP path to your folders.


<sect2>imap&lowbar;keepalive<label id="imap_keepalive">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 900

<p>
This variable specifies the maximum amount of time in seconds that mutt
will wait before polling open IMAP connections, to prevent the server
from closing them before mutt has finished with them. The default is
well within the RFC-specified minimum amount of time (30 minutes) before
a server is allowed to do this, but in practice the RFC does get
violated every now and then. Reduce this number if you find yourself
getting disconnected from your IMAP server due to inactivity.


<sect2>imap&lowbar;list&lowbar;subscribed<label id="imap_list_subscribed">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
This variable configures whether IMAP folder browsing will look for
only subscribed folders or all folders.  This can be toggled in the
IMAP browser with the <em>toggle-subscribed</em> function.


<sect2>imap&lowbar;pass<label id="imap_pass">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Specifies the password for your IMAP account.  If unset, Mutt will
prompt you for your password when you invoke the fetch-mail function.
<bf>Warning</bf>: you should only use this option when you are on a
fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your muttrc even
if you are the only one who can read the file.


<sect2>imap&lowbar;passive<label id="imap_passive">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When set, mutt will not open new IMAP connections to check for new
mail.  Mutt will only check for new mail over existing IMAP
connections.  This is useful if you don't want to be prompted to
user/password pairs on mutt invocation, or if opening the connection
is slow.


<sect2>imap&lowbar;peek<label id="imap_peek">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If set, mutt will avoid implicitly marking your mail as read whenever
you fetch a message from the server. This is generally a good thing,
but can make closing an IMAP folder somewhat slower. This option
exists to appease speed freaks.


<sect2>imap&lowbar;servernoise<label id="imap_servernoise">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When set, mutt will display warning messages from the IMAP
server as error messages. Since these messages are often
harmless, or generated due to configuration problems on the
server which are out of the users' hands, you may wish to suppress
them at some point.


<sect2>imap&lowbar;user<label id="imap_user">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Your login name on the IMAP server.
<p>
This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.


<sect2>implicit&lowbar;autoview<label id="implicit_autoview">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set to ``yes'', mutt will look for a mailcap entry with the
copiousoutput flag set for <em>every</em> MIME attachment it doesn't have
an internal viewer defined for.  If such an entry is found, mutt will
use the viewer defined in that entry to convert the body part to text
form.


<sect2>include<label id="include">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-yes

<p>
Controls whether or not a copy of the message(s) you are replying to
is included in your reply.


<sect2>indent&lowbar;string<label id="indent_string">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&gt; &dquot;

<p>
Specifies the string to prepend to each line of text quoted in a
message to which you are replying.  You are strongly encouraged not to
change this value, as it tends to agitate the more fanatical netizens.


<sect2>index&lowbar;format<label id="index_format">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&percnt;4C &percnt;Z &percnt;{&percnt;b &percnt;d} &percnt;-15.15L (&percnt;?l?&percnt;4l&amp;&percnt;4c?) &percnt;s&dquot;

<p>
This variable allows you to customize the message index display to
your personal taste.
<p>
``Format strings'' are similar to the strings used in the ``C''
function printf to format output (see the man page for more detail).
The following sequences are defined in Mutt:
<p>

<descrip>
<tag>&percnt;a </tag>address of the author
<tag>&percnt;A </tag>reply-to address (if present; otherwise: address of author)
<tag>&percnt;b </tag>filename of the original message folder (think mailBox)
<tag>&percnt;B </tag>the list to which the letter was sent, or else the folder name (&percnt;b).
<tag>&percnt;c </tag>number of characters (bytes) in the message
<tag>&percnt;C </tag>current message number
<tag>&percnt;d </tag>date and time of the message in the format specified by

mh, and possibly IMAP folders)
<tag>&percnt;L </tag>If an address in the To or CC header field matches an address
defined by the users ``subscribe'' command, this displays
&dquot;To &lt;list-name&gt;&dquot;, otherwise the same as &percnt;F.
<tag>&percnt;m </tag>total number of message in the mailbox
<tag>&percnt;M </tag>number of hidden messages if the thread is collapsed.
<tag>&percnt;N </tag>message score

<tag>&percnt;W </tag>name of organization of author (`organization:' field)
<tag>&percnt;y </tag>`x-label:' field, if present
<tag>&percnt;Y </tag>`x-label' field, if present, and (1) not at part of a thread tree,
(2) at the top of a thread, or (3) `x-label' is different from
preceding message's `x-label'.
<tag>&percnt;Z </tag>message status flags
<tag>&percnt;{fmt} </tag>the date and time of the message is converted to sender's
time zone, and ``fmt'' is expanded by the library function
``strftime''; a leading bang disables locales

time zone, and ``fmt'' is expanded by the library function
``strftime''; a leading bang disables locales
<tag>&percnt;(fmt) </tag>the local date and time when the message was received.
``fmt'' is expanded by the library function ``strftime'';
a leading bang disables locales
<tag>&percnt;&lt;fmt&gt; </tag>the current local time. ``fmt'' is expanded by the library
function ``strftime''; a leading bang disables locales.
<tag>&percnt;&gt;X    </tag>right justify the rest of the string and pad with character &dquot;X&dquot;
<tag>&percnt;|X    </tag>pad to the end of the line with character &dquot;X&dquot;
</descrip>

<p>
See also: ``<ref id="to_chars" name="&dollar;to&lowbar;chars">''.


<sect2>inews<label id="inews">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
If set, specifies the program and arguments used to deliver news posted
by Mutt.  Otherwise, mutt posts article using current connection to
news server.  The following printf-style sequence is understood:
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
%s      newsserver name

</verb></tscreen><p>
Example: set inews=&dquot;/usr/local/bin/inews -hS&dquot;


<sect2>ispell<label id="ispell">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;/sw/bin/ispell&dquot;

<p>
How to invoke ispell (GNU's spell-checking software).


<sect2>keep&lowbar;flagged<label id="keep_flagged">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, read messages marked as flagged will not be moved
from your spool mailbox to your ``<ref id="mbox" name="&dollar;mbox">'' mailbox, or as a result of
a ``<ref id="mbox-hook" name="mbox-hook">'' command.


<sect2>locale<label id="locale">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;C&dquot;

<p>
The locale used by <em>strftime(3)</em> to format dates. Legal values are
the strings your system accepts for the locale variable <em>LC&lowbar;TIME</em>.


<sect2>list&lowbar;reply<label id="list_reply">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set, address replies to the mailing list the original message came
from (instead to the author only). Setting this option to ``ask-yes'' or
``ask-no'' will ask if you really intended to reply to the author only.


<sect2>mail&lowbar;check<label id="mail_check">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 5

<p>
This variable configures how often (in seconds) mutt should look for
new mail.


<sect2>mailcap&lowbar;path<label id="mailcap_path">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
This variable specifies which files to consult when attempting to
display MIME bodies not directly supported by Mutt.


<sect2>mailcap&lowbar;sanitize<label id="mailcap_sanitize">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If set, mutt will restrict possible characters in mailcap &percnt; expandos
to a well-defined set of safe characters.  This is the safe setting,
but we are not sure it doesn't break some more advanced MIME stuff.
<p>
<bf>DON'T CHANGE THIS SETTING UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY SURE WHAT YOU ARE
DOING!</bf>


<sect2>maildir&lowbar;trash<label id="maildir_trash">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, messages marked as deleted will be saved with the maildir
(T)rashed flag instead of unlinked.  <bf>NOTE:</bf> this only applies
to maildir-style mailboxes.  Setting it will have no effect on other
mailbox types.


<sect2>mark&lowbar;old<label id="mark_old">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
Controls whether or not mutt marks <em>new</em> <bf>unread</bf>
messages as <em>old</em> if you exit a mailbox without reading them.
With this option set, the next time you start mutt, the messages
will show up with an &dquot;O&dquot; next to them in the index menu,
indicating that they are old.


<sect2>markers<label id="markers">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
Controls the display of wrapped lines in the internal pager. If set, a
``+'' marker is displayed at the beginning of wrapped lines. Also see
the ``<ref id="smart_wrap" name="&dollar;smart&lowbar;wrap">'' variable.


<sect2>mask<label id="mask">
<p>
Type: regular expression<newline>
Default: &dquot;!^&bsol;.&lsqb;^.&rsqb;&dquot;

<p>
A regular expression used in the file browser, optionally preceded by
the <em>not</em> operator ``!''.  Only files whose names match this mask
will be shown. The match is always case-sensitive.


<sect2>mbox<label id="mbox">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&tilde;/mbox&dquot;

<p>
This specifies the folder into which read mail in your ``<ref id="spoolfile" name="&dollar;spoolfile">''
folder will be appended.


<sect2>sidebar&lowbar;visible<label id="sidebar_visible">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
This specifies whether or not to show the mailbox list pane.


<sect2>sidebar&lowbar;width<label id="sidebar_width">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 0

<p>
The width of the mailbox list pane (left sidebar like in GUIs).


<sect2>mbox&lowbar;type<label id="mbox_type">
<p>
Type: folder magic<newline>
Default: mbox

<p>
The default mailbox type used when creating new folders. May be any of
mbox, MMDF, MH and Maildir.


<sect2>metoo<label id="metoo">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If unset, Mutt will remove your address (see the ``alternates''
command) from the list of recipients when replying to a message.


<sect2>menu&lowbar;scroll<label id="menu_scroll">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When <em>set</em>, menus will be scrolled up or down one line when you
attempt to move across a screen boundary.  If <em>unset</em>, the screen
is cleared and the next or previous page of the menu is displayed
(useful for slow links to avoid many redraws).


<sect2>meta&lowbar;key<label id="meta_key">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, forces Mutt to interpret keystrokes with the high bit (bit 8)
set as if the user had pressed the ESC key and whatever key remains
after having the high bit removed.  For example, if the key pressed
has an ASCII value of 0xf4, then this is treated as if the user had
pressed ESC then ``x''.  This is because the result of removing the
high bit from ``0xf4'' is ``0x74'', which is the ASCII character
``x''.


<sect2>mh&lowbar;purge<label id="mh_purge">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When unset, mutt will mimic mh's behaviour and rename deleted messages
to <em>,&lt;old file name&gt;</em> in mh folders instead of really deleting
them.  If the variable is set, the message files will simply be
deleted.


<sect2>mh&lowbar;seq&lowbar;flagged<label id="mh_seq_flagged">
<p>
Type: string<newline>

<p>
The name of the MH sequence used for unseen messages.


<sect2>mime&lowbar;forward<label id="mime_forward">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set, the message you are forwarding will be attached as a
separate MIME part instead of included in the main body of the
message.  This is useful for forwarding MIME messages so the receiver
can properly view the message as it was delivered to you. If you like
to switch between MIME and not MIME from mail to mail, set this
variable to ask-no or ask-yes.
<p>
Also see ``<ref id="forward_decode" name="&dollar;forward&lowbar;decode">'' and ``<ref id="mime_forward_decode" name="&dollar;mime&lowbar;forward&lowbar;decode">''.

Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
Controls the decoding of complex MIME messages into text/plain when
forwarding a message while ``<ref id="mime_forward" name="&dollar;mime&lowbar;forward">'' is <em>set</em>. Otherwise
``<ref id="forward_decode" name="&dollar;forward&lowbar;decode">'' is used instead.


<sect2>mime&lowbar;forward&lowbar;rest<label id="mime_forward_rest">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When forwarding multiple attachments of a MIME message from the recvattach
menu, attachments which cannot be decoded in a reasonable manner will
be attached to the newly composed message if this option is set.


<sect2>mime&lowbar;subject<label id="mime_subject">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If <em>unset</em>, 8-bit ``subject:'' line in article header will not be
encoded according to RFC2047 to base64.  This is useful when message
is Usenet article, because MIME for news is nonstandard feature.


<sect2>mix&lowbar;entry&lowbar;format<label id="mix_entry_format">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&percnt;4n &percnt;c &percnt;-16s &percnt;a&dquot;

<p>
This variable describes the format of a remailer line on the mixmaster
chain selection screen.  The following printf-like sequences are

Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-no

<p>
Controls whether you will be asked to confirm moving read messages
from your spool mailbox to your ``<ref id="mbox" name="&dollar;mbox">'' mailbox, or as a result of
a ``<ref id="mbox-hook" name="mbox-hook">'' command.


<sect2>message&lowbar;format<label id="message_format">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&percnt;s&dquot;

<p>
This is the string displayed in the ``attachment'' menu for
attachments of type message/rfc822.  For a full listing of defined
printf()-like sequences see the section on ``<ref id="index_format" name="&dollar;index&lowbar;format">''.


<sect2>narrow&lowbar;tree<label id="narrow_tree">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
This variable, when set, makes the thread tree narrower, allowing
deeper threads to fit on the screen.


<sect2>news&lowbar;cache&lowbar;dir<label id="news_cache_dir">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&tilde;/.mutt&dquot;

<p>
This variable pointing to directory where Mutt will save cached news
articles headers in. If <em>unset</em>, headers will not be saved at all
and will be reloaded each time when you enter to newsgroup.


<sect2>news&lowbar;server<label id="news_server">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
This variable specifies domain name or address of NNTP server. It
defaults to the newsserver specified in the environment variable
&dollar;NNTPSERVER or contained in the file /etc/nntpserver.  You can also
specify username and an alternative port for each newsserver, ie:
<p>
&lsqb;nntp&lsqb;s&rsqb;://&rsqb;&lsqb;username&lsqb;:password&rsqb;@&rsqb;newsserver&lsqb;:port&rsqb;


<sect2>newsrc<label id="newsrc">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&tilde;/.newsrc&dquot;

<p>
The file, containing info about subscribed newsgroups - names and
indexes of read articles.  The following printf-style sequence
is understood:
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
%s      newsserver name

</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>nntp&lowbar;context<label id="nntp_context">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 1000

<p>
This variable defines number of articles which will be in index when
newsgroup entered.  If active newsgroup have more articles than this
number, oldest articles will be ignored.  Also controls how many
articles headers will be saved in cache when you quit newsgroup.


<sect2>nntp&lowbar;load&lowbar;description<label id="nntp_load_description">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
This variable controls whether or not descriptions for each newsgroup
must be loaded when newsgroup is added to list (first time list
loading or new newsgroup adding).


<sect2>nntp&lowbar;user<label id="nntp_user">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Your login name on the NNTP server.  If <em>unset</em> and NNTP server requires
authentification, Mutt will prompt you for your account name when you
connect to newsserver.


<sect2>nntp&lowbar;pass<label id="nntp_pass">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Your password for NNTP account.


<sect2>nntp&lowbar;poll<label id="nntp_poll">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 60

<p>
The time in seconds until any operations on newsgroup except post new
article will cause recheck for new news.  If set to 0, Mutt will
recheck newsgroup on each operation in index (stepping, read article,
etc.).


<sect2>nntp&lowbar;reconnect<label id="nntp_reconnect">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-yes

<p>
Controls whether or not Mutt will try to reconnect to newsserver when
connection lost.


<sect2>pager<label id="pager">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;builtin&dquot;

<p>
This variable specifies which pager you would like to use to view
messages.  builtin means to use the builtin pager, otherwise this
variable should specify the pathname of the external pager you would
like to use.
<p>
Using an external pager may have some disadvantages: Additional
keystrokes are necessary because you can't call mutt functions
directly from the pager, and screen resizes cause lines longer than
the screen width to be badly formatted in the help menu.


<sect2>pager&lowbar;context<label id="pager_context">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 0

<p>
This variable controls the number of lines of context that are given
when displaying the next or previous page in the internal pager.  By
default, Mutt will display the line after the last one on the screen
at the top of the next page (0 lines of context).


<sect2>pager&lowbar;format<label id="pager_format">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;-&percnt;Z- &percnt;C/&percnt;m: &percnt;-20.20n   &percnt;s&dquot;

<p>
This variable controls the format of the one-line message ``status''
displayed before each message in either the internal or an external
pager.  The valid sequences are listed in the ``<ref id="index_format" name="&dollar;index&lowbar;format">''
section.


<sect2>pager&lowbar;index&lowbar;lines<label id="pager_index_lines">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 0

<p>
Determines the number of lines of a mini-index which is shown when in
the pager.  The current message, unless near the top or bottom of the
folder, will be roughly one third of the way down this mini-index,
giving the reader the context of a few messages before and after the
message.  This is useful, for example, to determine how many messages
remain to be read in the current thread.  One of the lines is reserved
for the status bar from the index, so a <em>pager&lowbar;index&lowbar;lines</em> of 6
will only show 5 lines of the actual index.  A value of 0 results in
no index being shown.  If the number of messages in the current folder
is less than <em>pager&lowbar;index&lowbar;lines</em>, then the index will only use as
many lines as it needs.


<sect2>pager&lowbar;stop<label id="pager_stop">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set, the internal-pager will <bf>not</bf> move to the next message
when you are at the end of a message and invoke the <em>next-page</em>
function.


<sect2>crypt&lowbar;autosign<label id="crypt_autosign">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to
cryptographically sign outgoing messages.  This can be overridden
by use of the <em>pgp-menu</em>, when signing is not required or
encryption is requested as well. If ``<ref id="smime_is_default" name="&dollar;smime&lowbar;is&lowbar;default">'' is set,
then OpenSSL is used instead to create S/MIME messages and settings can
be overridden by use of the <em>smime-menu</em>.
(Crypto only)


<sect2>crypt&lowbar;autoencrypt<label id="crypt_autoencrypt">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
Setting this variable will cause Mutt to always attempt to PGP
encrypt outgoing messages.  This is probably only useful in
connection to the <em>send-hook</em> command.  It can be overridden
by use of the <em>pgp-menu</em>, when encryption is not required or
signing is requested as well.  IF ``<ref id="smime_is_default" name="&dollar;smime&lowbar;is&lowbar;default">'' is set,
then OpenSSL is used instead to create S/MIME messages and
settings can be overridden by use of the <em>smime-menu</em>.
(Crypto only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;ignore&lowbar;subkeys<label id="pgp_ignore_subkeys">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
Setting this variable will cause Mutt to ignore OpenPGP subkeys. Instead,
the principal key will inherit the subkeys' capabilities.  Unset this
if you want to play interesting key selection games.
(PGP only)


<sect2>crypt&lowbar;replyencrypt<label id="crypt_replyencrypt">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If set, automatically PGP or OpenSSL encrypt replies to messages which are
encrypted.
(Crypto only)


<sect2>crypt&lowbar;replysign<label id="crypt_replysign">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, automatically PGP or OpenSSL sign replies to messages which are
signed.
<p>
<bf>Note:</bf> this does not work on messages that are encrypted
<bf>and</bf> signed!
(Crypto only)


<sect2>crypt&lowbar;replysignencrypted<label id="crypt_replysignencrypted">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, automatically PGP or OpenSSL sign replies to messages
which are encrypted. This makes sense in combination with
``<ref id="crypt_replyencrypt" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;replyencrypt">'', because it allows you to sign all
messages which are automatically encrypted.  This works around
the problem noted in ``<ref id="crypt_replysign" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;replysign">'', that mutt is not able
to find out whether an encrypted message is also signed.
(Crypto only)


<sect2>crypt&lowbar;timestamp<label id="crypt_timestamp">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If set, mutt will include a time stamp in the lines surrounding
PGP or S/MIME output, so spoofing such lines is more difficult.
If you are using colors to mark these lines, and rely on these,
you may unset this setting.
(Crypto only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;use&lowbar;gpg&lowbar;agent<label id="pgp_use_gpg_agent">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, mutt will use a possibly-running gpg-agent process.
(PGP only)


<sect2>crypt&lowbar;verify&lowbar;sig<label id="crypt_verify_sig">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If ``yes'', always attempt to verify PGP or S/MIME signatures.
If ``ask'', ask whether or not to verify the signature. 
If ``no'', never attempt to verify cryptographic signatures.
(Crypto only)


<sect2>smime&lowbar;is&lowbar;default<label id="smime_is_default">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
The default behaviour of mutt is to use PGP on all auto-sign/encryption
operations. To override and to use OpenSSL instead this must be set.
However, this has no effect while replying, since mutt will automatically 
select the same application that was used to sign/encrypt the original
message.  (Note that this variable can be overridden by unsetting <ref id="crypt_autosmime" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;autosmime">.)
(S/MIME only)


<sect2>smime&lowbar;ask&lowbar;cert&lowbar;label<label id="smime_ask_cert_label">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
This flag controls whether you want to be asked to enter a label
for a certificate about to be added to the database or not. It is
set by default.
(S/MIME only)


<sect2>smime&lowbar;decrypt&lowbar;use&lowbar;default&lowbar;key<label id="smime_decrypt_use_default_key">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If set (default) this tells mutt to use the default key for decryption. Otherwise,
if manage multiple certificate-key-pairs, mutt will try to use the mailbox-address
to determine the key to use. It will ask you to supply a key, if it can't find one.
(S/MIME only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;entry&lowbar;format<label id="pgp_entry_format">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&percnt;4n &percnt;t&percnt;f &percnt;4l/0x&percnt;k &percnt;-4a &percnt;2c &percnt;u&dquot;

<p>
This variable allows you to customize the PGP key selection menu to
your personal taste. This string is similar to ``<ref id="index_format" name="&dollar;index&lowbar;format">'', but
has its own set of printf()-like sequences:
<p>

<descrip>
<tag>&percnt;n     </tag>number
<tag>&percnt;k     </tag>key id
<tag>&percnt;u     </tag>user id
<tag>&percnt;a     </tag>algorithm
<tag>&percnt;l     </tag>key length
<tag>&percnt;f     </tag>flags
<tag>&percnt;c     </tag>capabilities
<tag>&percnt;t     </tag>trust/validity of the key-uid association
<tag>&percnt;&lsqb;&lt;s&gt;&rsqb; </tag>date of the key where &lt;s&gt; is an strftime(3) expression
</descrip>

<p>
(PGP only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;good&lowbar;sign<label id="pgp_good_sign">
<p>
Type: regular expression<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
If you assign a text to this variable, then a PGP signature is only
considered verified if the output from <ref id="pgp_verify_command" name="&dollar;pgp&lowbar;verify&lowbar;command"> contains
the text. Use this variable if the exit code from the command is 0
even for bad signatures.
(PGP only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;check&lowbar;exit<label id="pgp_check_exit">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If set, mutt will check the exit code of the PGP subprocess when
signing or encrypting.  A non-zero exit code means that the
subprocess failed.
(PGP only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;long&lowbar;ids<label id="pgp_long_ids">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, use 64 bit PGP key IDs. Unset uses the normal 32 bit Key IDs.
(PGP only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;retainable&lowbar;sigs<label id="pgp_retainable_sigs">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, signed and encrypted messages will consist of nested
multipart/signed and multipart/encrypted body parts.
<p>
This is useful for applications like encrypted and signed mailing
lists, where the outer layer (multipart/encrypted) can be easily
removed, while the inner multipart/signed part is retained.
(PGP only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;show&lowbar;unusable<label id="pgp_show_unusable">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If set, mutt will display non-usable keys on the PGP key selection
menu.  This includes keys which have been revoked, have expired, or
have been marked as ``disabled'' by the user.
(PGP only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;sign&lowbar;as<label id="pgp_sign_as">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
If you have more than one key pair, this option allows you to specify
which of your private keys to use.  It is recommended that you use the
keyid form to specify your key (e.g., ``0x00112233'').
(PGP only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;strict&lowbar;enc<label id="pgp_strict_enc">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If set, Mutt will automatically encode PGP/MIME signed messages as
<em>quoted-printable</em>.  Please note that unsetting this variable may
lead to problems with non-verifyable PGP signatures, so only change
this if you know what you are doing.
(PGP only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;timeout<label id="pgp_timeout">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 300

<p>
The number of seconds after which a cached passphrase will expire if
not used.
(PGP only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;sort&lowbar;keys<label id="pgp_sort_keys">
<p>
Type: sort order<newline>
Default: address

<p>
Specifies how the entries in the `pgp keys' menu are sorted. The
following are legal values:
<p>

<descrip>
<tag>address </tag>sort alphabetically by user id
<tag>keyid   </tag>sort alphabetically by key id
<tag>date    </tag>sort by key creation date
<tag>trust   </tag>sort by the trust of the key
</descrip>

<p>
If you prefer reverse order of the above values, prefix it with
`reverse-'.
(PGP only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;create&lowbar;traditional<label id="pgp_create_traditional">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: no

<p>
This option controls whether Mutt generates old-style inline PGP
encrypted or signed messages.
<p>
Note that PGP/MIME will be used automatically for messages which have
a character set different from us-ascii, or which consist of more than
a single MIME part.
<p>
Also note that using the old-style PGP message format is <bf>strongly</bf>
<bf>deprecated</bf>.
(PGP only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;auto&lowbar;traditional<label id="pgp_auto_traditional">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
This option causes Mutt to generate an old-style inline PGP
encrypted or signed message when replying to an old-style
message, and a PGP/MIME message when replying to a PGP/MIME
message.  Note that this option is only meaningful when using
``<ref id="crypt_replyencrypt" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;replyencrypt">'', ``<ref id="crypt_replysign" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;replysign">'', or
``<ref id="crypt_replysignencrypted" name="&dollar;crypt&lowbar;replysignencrypted">''.
<p>
Also note that PGP/MIME will be used automatically for messages
which have a character set different from us-ascii, or which
consist of more than a single MIME part.
<p>
This option overrides ``<ref id="pgp_create_traditional" name="&dollar;pgp&lowbar;create&lowbar;traditional">''
(PGP only)


<sect2>pgp&lowbar;decode&lowbar;command<label id="pgp_decode_command">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
This format strings specifies a command which is used to decode 
application/pgp attachments.
<p>
The PGP command formats have their own set of printf-like sequences:
<p>

<descrip>
<tag>&percnt;p </tag>Expands to PGPPASSFD=0 when a pass phrase is needed, to an empty
string otherwise. Note: This may be used with a &percnt;? construct.
<tag>&percnt;f </tag>Expands to the name of a file containing a message.
<tag>&percnt;s </tag>Expands to the name of a file containing the signature part
           of a multipart/signed attachment when verifying it.
<tag>&percnt;a </tag>The value of <ref id="pgp_sign_as" name="&dollar;pgp&lowbar;sign&lowbar;as">.
<tag>&percnt;r </tag>One or more key IDs.
</descrip>

<p>
For examples on how to configure these formats for the various versions
of PGP which are floating around, see the pgp*.rc and gpg.rc files in
the samples/ subdirectory which has been installed on your system
alongside the documentation.

Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
This sets the algorithm that should be used for encryption.
Valid choices are &dquot;des&dquot;, &dquot;des3&dquot;, &dquot;rc2-40&dquot;, &dquot;rc2-64&dquot;, &dquot;rc2-128&dquot;.
If unset &dquot;3des&dquot; (TripleDES) is used.

<sect2>smime&lowbar;keys<label id="smime_keys">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Since there is no pubring/secring as with PGP, mutt has to handle
storage ad retrieval of keys/certs by itself. This is very basic right now,
and stores keys and certificates in two different directories, both
named as the hash-value retrieved from OpenSSL. There is an index file
which contains mailbox-address keyid pair, and which can be manually
edited. This one points to the location of the private keys.
(S/MIME only)


<sect2>smime&lowbar;ca&lowbar;location<label id="smime_ca_location">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
This format string specifies a command which is used to decrypt
application/x-pkcs7-mime attachments.
<p>
The OpenSSL command formats have their own set of printf-like sequences
similar to PGP's:
<p>

<descrip>
<tag>&percnt;f </tag>Expands to the name of a file containing a message.
<tag>&percnt;s </tag>Expands to the name of a file containing the signature part
           of a multipart/signed attachment when verifying it.
<tag>&percnt;k </tag>The key-pair specified with <ref id="smime_default_key" name="&dollar;smime&lowbar;default&lowbar;key">
<tag>&percnt;c </tag>One or more certificate IDs.
<tag>&percnt;a </tag>The algorithm used for encryption.
<tag>&percnt;C </tag>CA location:  Depending on whether <ref id="smime_ca_location" name="&dollar;smime&lowbar;ca&lowbar;location">
           points to a directory or file, this expands to 
           &dquot;-CApath <ref id="smime_ca_location" name="&dollar;smime&lowbar;ca&lowbar;location">&dquot; or &dquot;-CAfile <ref id="smime_ca_location" name="&dollar;smime&lowbar;ca&lowbar;location">&dquot;.
</descrip>

<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Defines the password to use with SMTP AUTH.  If ``<ref id="smtp_auth_username" name="&dollar;smtp&lowbar;auth&lowbar;username">''
is set, but this variable is not, you will be prompted for a password
when sending.


<sect2>smtp&lowbar;host<label id="smtp_host">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Defines the SMTP host which will be used to deliver mail, as opposed
to invoking the sendmail binary.  Setting this variable overrides the
value of ``<ref id="sendmail" name="&dollar;sendmail">'', and any associated variables.


<sect2>smtp&lowbar;port<label id="smtp_port">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 25

<p>
Defines the port that the SMTP host is listening on for mail delivery.
Must be specified as a number.
<p>
Defaults to 25, the standard SMTP port, but RFC 2476-compliant SMTP
servers will probably desire 587, the mail submission port.


<sect2>ssl&lowbar;starttls<label id="ssl_starttls">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If set (the default), mutt will attempt to use STARTTLS on servers
advertising the capability. When unset, mutt will not attempt to
use STARTTLS regardless of the server's capabilities.


<sect2>certificate&lowbar;file<label id="certificate_file">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
This variable specifies the file where the certificates you trust
are saved. When an unknown certificate is encountered, you are asked
if you accept it or not. If you accept it, the certificate can also 
be saved in this file and further connections are automatically 
accepted.
<p>
You can also manually add CA certificates in this file. Any server
certificate that is signed with one of these CA certificates are 
also automatically accepted.
<p>
Example: set certificate&lowbar;file=&tilde;/.mutt/certificates


<sect2>ssl&lowbar;usesystemcerts<label id="ssl_usesystemcerts">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If set to <em>yes</em>, mutt will use CA certificates in the

<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
Used in connection with the <em>pipe-message</em> command and the ``tag-
prefix'' operator.  If this variable is unset, when piping a list of
tagged messages Mutt will concatenate the messages and will pipe them
as a single folder.  When set, Mutt will pipe the messages one by one.
In both cases the messages are piped in the current sorted order,
and the ``<ref id="pipe_sep" name="&dollar;pipe&lowbar;sep">'' separator is added after each message.


<sect2>pipe&lowbar;decode<label id="pipe_decode">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
Used in connection with the <em>pipe-message</em> command.  When unset,
Mutt will pipe the messages without any preprocessing. When set, Mutt
will weed headers and will attempt to PGP/MIME decode the messages
first.


<sect2>pipe&lowbar;sep<label id="pipe_sep">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&bsol;n&dquot;

<p>

messages to an external Unix command.


<sect2>pop&lowbar;authenticators<label id="pop_authenticators">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
This is a colon-delimited list of authentication methods mutt may
attempt to use to log in to an POP server, in the order mutt should
try them.  Authentication methods are either 'user', 'apop' or any
SASL mechanism, eg 'digest-md5', 'gssapi' or 'cram-md5'.
This parameter is case-insensitive. If this parameter is unset
(the default) mutt will try all available methods, in order from
most-secure to least-secure.
<p>
Example: set pop&lowbar;authenticators=&dquot;digest-md5:apop:user&dquot;


<sect2>pop&lowbar;auth&lowbar;try&lowbar;all<label id="pop_auth_try_all">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If set, Mutt will try all available methods. When unset, Mutt will
only fall back to other authentication methods if the previous
methods are unavailable. If a method is available but authentication
fails, Mutt will not connect to the POP server.


<sect2>pop&lowbar;checkinterval<label id="pop_checkinterval">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 60

<p>
This variable configures how often (in seconds) POP should look for
new mail.


<sect2>pop&lowbar;delete<label id="pop_delete">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-no

<p>
If set, Mutt will delete successfully downloaded messages from the POP
server when using the fetch-mail function.  When unset, Mutt will
download messages but also leave them on the POP server.


<sect2>pop&lowbar;host<label id="pop_host">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
The name of your POP server for the fetch-mail function.  You

<sect2>pop&lowbar;last<label id="pop_last">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If this variable is set, mutt will try to use the &dquot;LAST&dquot; POP command
for retrieving only unread messages from the POP server when using
the fetch-mail function.


<sect2>pop&lowbar;reconnect<label id="pop_reconnect">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-yes

<p>
Controls whether or not Mutt will try to reconnect to POP server when
connection lost.


<sect2>pop&lowbar;user<label id="pop_user">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Your login name on the POP server.
<p>
This variable defaults to your user name on the local machine.


<sect2>pop&lowbar;pass<label id="pop_pass">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Specifies the password for your POP account.  If unset, Mutt will
prompt you for your password when you open POP mailbox.
<bf>Warning</bf>: you should only use this option when you are on a
fairly secure machine, because the superuser can read your muttrc
even if you are the only one who can read the file.


<sect2>post&lowbar;indent&lowbar;string<label id="post_indent_string">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Similar to the ``<ref id="attribution" name="&dollar;attribution">'' variable, Mutt will append this
string after the inclusion of a message which is being replied to.


<sect2>post&lowbar;moderated<label id="post_moderated">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-yes

<p>
If set to <em>yes</em>, Mutt will post article to newsgroup that have
not permissions to posting (e.g. moderated).  <bf>Note:</bf> if newsserver
does not support posting to that newsgroup or totally read-only, that
posting will not have an effect.


<sect2>postpone<label id="postpone">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-yes

<p>
Controls whether or not messages are saved in the ``<ref id="postponed" name="&dollar;postponed">''
mailbox when you elect not to send immediately.


<sect2>postponed<label id="postponed">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&tilde;/postponed&dquot;

<p>
Mutt allows you to indefinitely ``<ref id="postpone" name="postpone"> sending a message'' which
you are editing.  When you choose to postpone a message, Mutt saves it
in the mailbox specified by this variable.  Also see the ``<ref id="postpone" name="&dollar;postpone">''
variable.


<sect2>preconnect<label id="preconnect">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
If set, a shell command to be executed if mutt fails to establish
a connection to the server. This is useful for setting up secure
connections, e.g. with ssh(1). If the command returns a  nonzero
status, mutt gives up opening the server. Example:
<p>
preconnect=&dquot;ssh -f -q -L 1234:mailhost.net:143 mailhost.net
sleep 20 &lt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null&dquot;
<p>
Mailbox 'foo' on mailhost.net can now be reached
as '{localhost:1234}foo'.
<p>
NOTE: For this example to work, you must be able to log in to the
remote machine without having to enter a password.


<sect2>print<label id="print">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-no

<p>
Controls whether or not Mutt asks for confirmation before printing.
This is useful for people (like me) who accidentally hit ``p'' often.


<sect2>print&lowbar;command<label id="print_command">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;lpr&dquot;

<p>
This specifies the command pipe that should be used to print messages.


<sect2>print&lowbar;decode<label id="print_decode">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
Used in connection with the print-message command.  If this
option is set, the message is decoded before it is passed to the
external command specified by <ref id="print_command" name="&dollar;print&lowbar;command">.  If this option
is unset, no processing will be applied to the message when
printing it.  The latter setting may be useful if you are using
some advanced printer filter which is able to properly format
e-mail messages for printing.


<sect2>print&lowbar;split<label id="print_split">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
Used in connection with the print-message command.  If this option
is set, the command specified by <ref id="print_command" name="&dollar;print&lowbar;command"> is executed once for
each message which is to be printed.  If this option is unset, 
the command specified by <ref id="print_command" name="&dollar;print&lowbar;command"> is executed only once, and
all the messages are concatenated, with a form feed as the message
separator.
<p>
Those who use the <bf>enscript</bf>(1) program's mail-printing mode will
most likely want to set this option.


<sect2>prompt&lowbar;after<label id="prompt_after">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If you use an <em>external</em> ``<ref id="pager" name="&dollar;pager">'', setting this variable will
cause Mutt to prompt you for a command when the pager exits rather
than returning to the index menu.  If unset, Mutt will return to the
index menu when the external pager exits.


<sect2>query&lowbar;command<label id="query_command">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
This specifies the command that mutt will use to make external address
queries.  The string should contain a &percnt;s, which will be substituted
with the query string the user types.  See ``<ref id="query" name="query">'' for more
information.


<sect2>quit<label id="quit">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
This variable controls whether ``quit'' and ``exit'' actually quit
from mutt.  If it set to yes, they do quit, if it is set to no, they
have no effect, and if it is set to ask-yes or ask-no, you are
prompted for confirmation when you try to quit.


<sect2>quote&lowbar;empty<label id="quote_empty">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
Controls whether or not empty lines will be quoted using
``<ref id="indent_string" name="indent&lowbar;string">''.


<sect2>quote&lowbar;quoted<label id="quote_quoted">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
Controls how quoted lines will be quoted. If set, one quote
character will be added to the end of existing prefix.  Otherwise,
quoted lines will be prepended by ``<ref id="indent_string" name="indent&lowbar;string">''.


<sect2>quote&lowbar;regexp<label id="quote_regexp">
<p>
Type: regular expression<newline>
Default: &dquot;^(&lsqb; &bsol;t&rsqb;*&lsqb;|&gt;:}#&rsqb;)+&dquot;

<p>
A regular expression used in the internal-pager to determine quoted
sections of text in the body of a message.
<p>
<bf>Note:</bf> In order to use the <em>quoted</em><bf>x</bf> patterns in the
internal pager, you need to set this to a regular expression that
matches <em>exactly</em> the quote characters at the beginning of quoted
lines.


<sect2>read&lowbar;inc<label id="read_inc">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 10

<p>
If set to a value greater than 0, Mutt will display which message it
is currently on when reading a mailbox.  The message is printed after
<em>read&lowbar;inc</em> messages have been read (e.g., if set to 25, Mutt will
print a message when it reads message 25, and then again when it gets
to message 50).  This variable is meant to indicate progress when
reading large mailboxes which may take some time.
When set to 0, only a single message will appear before the reading
the mailbox.
<p>
Also see the ``<ref id="write_inc" name="&dollar;write&lowbar;inc">'' variable.


<sect2>read&lowbar;only<label id="read_only">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, all folders are opened in read-only mode.


<sect2>realname<label id="realname">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
This variable specifies what &dquot;real&dquot; or &dquot;personal&dquot; name should be used
when sending messages.
<p>
By default, this is the GECOS field from /etc/passwd.  Note that this
variable will <em>not</em> be used when the user has set a real name
in the <ref id="from" name="&dollar;from"> variable.


<sect2>recall<label id="recall">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-yes

<p>
Controls whether or not you are prompted to recall postponed messages
when composing a new message.  Also see ``<ref id="postponed" name="&dollar;postponed">''.
<p>
Setting this variable to ``yes'' is not generally useful, and thus not
recommended.


<sect2>record<label id="record">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
This specifies the file into which your outgoing messages should be
appended.  (This is meant as the primary method for saving a copy of
your messages, but another way to do this is using the ``<ref id="my_hdr" name="my&lowbar;hdr">''
command to create a <em>Bcc:</em> field with your email address in it.)
<p>
The value of <em><ref id="record" name="&dollar;record"></em> is overridden by the ``<ref id="force_name" name="&dollar;force&lowbar;name">'' and
``<ref id="save_name" name="&dollar;save&lowbar;name">'' variables, and the ``<ref id="fcc-hook" name="fcc-hook">'' command.


<sect2>reply&lowbar;regexp<label id="reply_regexp">
<p>
Type: regular expression<newline>
Default: &dquot;^(re(&lsqb;&bsol;&lsqb;0-9&bsol;&rsqb;+&rsqb;)*|aw):&lsqb; &bsol;t&rsqb;*&dquot;

<p>
A regular expression used to recognize reply messages when threading
and replying. The default value corresponds to the English &dquot;Re:&dquot; and
the German &dquot;Aw:&dquot;.


<sect2>reply&lowbar;self<label id="reply_self">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If unset and you are replying to a message sent by you, Mutt will
assume that you want to reply to the recipients of that message rather
than to yourself.


<sect2>reply&lowbar;to<label id="reply_to">
<p>
Type: quadoption<newline>
Default: ask-yes

<p>
If set, Mutt will ask you if you want to use the address listed in the
Reply-To: header field when replying to a message.  If you answer no,
it will use the address in the From: header field instead.  This
option is useful for reading a mailing list that sets the Reply-To:
header field to the list address and you want to send a private
message to the author of a message.


<sect2>resolve<label id="resolve">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When set, the cursor will be automatically advanced to the next
(possibly undeleted) message whenever a command that modifies the
current message is executed.


<sect2>reverse&lowbar;alias<label id="reverse_alias">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
This variable controls whether or not Mutt will display the &dquot;personal&dquot;
name from your aliases in the index menu if it finds an alias that
matches the message's sender.  For example, if you have the following
alias:
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
alias juser abd30425@somewhere.net (Joe User)

</verb></tscreen><p>
and then you receive mail which contains the following header:
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
From: abd30425@somewhere.net

</verb></tscreen><p>
It would be displayed in the index menu as ``Joe User'' instead of
``abd30425@somewhere.net.''  This is useful when the person's e-mail
address is not human friendly (like CompuServe addresses).


<sect2>reverse&lowbar;name<label id="reverse_name">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
It may sometimes arrive that you receive mail to a certain machine,
move the messages to another machine, and reply to some the messages
from there.  If this variable is set, the default <em>From:</em> line of
the reply messages is built using the address where you received the
messages you are replying to.  If the variable is unset, the
<em>From:</em> line will use your address on the current machine.


<sect2>reverse&lowbar;realname<label id="reverse_realname">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
This variable fine-tunes the behaviour of the <ref id="reverse_name" name="reverse&lowbar;name"> feature.
When it is set, mutt will use the address from incoming messages as-is,
possibly including eventual real names.  When it is unset, mutt will
override any such real names with the setting of the <ref id="realname" name="realname"> variable.


<sect2>rfc2047&lowbar;parameters<label id="rfc2047_parameters">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When this variable is set, Mutt will decode RFC-2047-encoded MIME 
parameters. You want to set this variable when mutt suggests you
to save attachments to files named like this: 
=?iso-8859-1?Q?file=5F=E4=5F991116=2Ezip?=
<p>
When this variable is set interactively, the change doesn't have
the desired effect before you have changed folders.
<p>
Note that this use of RFC 2047's encoding is explicitly,
prohibited by the standard, but nevertheless encountered in the
wild.
Also note that setting this parameter will <em>not</em> have the effect 
that mutt <em>generates</em> this kind of encoding.  Instead, mutt will
unconditionally use the encoding specified in RFC 2231.


<sect2>save&lowbar;address<label id="save_address">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, mutt will take the sender's full address when choosing a
default folder for saving a mail. If ``<ref id="save_name" name="&dollar;save&lowbar;name">'' or ``<ref id="force_name" name="&dollar;force&lowbar;name">''
is set too, the selection of the fcc folder will be changed as well.


<sect2>save&lowbar;empty<label id="save_empty">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When unset, mailboxes which contain no saved messages will be removed
when closed (the exception is ``<ref id="spoolfile" name="&dollar;spoolfile">'' which is never removed).
If set, mailboxes are never removed.
<p>
<bf>Note:</bf> This only applies to mbox and MMDF folders, Mutt does not
delete MH and Maildir directories.


<sect2>save&lowbar;name<label id="save_name">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
This variable controls how copies of outgoing messages are saved.
When set, a check is made to see if a mailbox specified by the
recipient address exists (this is done by searching for a mailbox in
the ``<ref id="folder" name="&dollar;folder">'' directory with the <em>username</em> part of the
recipient address).  If the mailbox exists, the outgoing message will
be saved to that mailbox, otherwise the message is saved to the
``<ref id="record" name="&dollar;record">'' mailbox.
<p>
Also see the ``<ref id="force_name" name="&dollar;force&lowbar;name">'' variable.


<sect2>score<label id="score">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When this variable is <em>unset</em>, scoring is turned off.  This can
be useful to selectively disable scoring for certain folders when the
``<ref id="score_threshold_delete" name="&dollar;score&lowbar;threshold&lowbar;delete">'' variable and friends are used.


<sect2>score&lowbar;threshold&lowbar;delete<label id="score_threshold_delete">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: -1

<p>
Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
of this variable are automatically marked for deletion by mutt.  Since
mutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
of this variable will never mark a message for deletion.


<sect2>score&lowbar;threshold&lowbar;flag<label id="score_threshold_flag">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 9999

<p>
Messages which have been assigned a score greater than or equal to this 
variable's value are automatically marked &dquot;flagged&dquot;.


<sect2>score&lowbar;threshold&lowbar;read<label id="score_threshold_read">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: -1

<p>
Messages which have been assigned a score equal to or lower than the value
of this variable are automatically marked as read by mutt.  Since
mutt scores are always greater than or equal to zero, the default setting
of this variable will never mark a message read.


<sect2>send&lowbar;charset<label id="send_charset">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;us-ascii:iso-8859-1:utf-8&dquot;

<p>
A list of character sets for outgoing messages. Mutt will use the
first character set into which the text can be converted exactly.
If your ``<ref id="charset" name="&dollar;charset">'' is not iso-8859-1 and recipients may not
understand UTF-8, it is advisable to include in the list an
appropriate widely used standard character set (such as
iso-8859-2, koi8-r or iso-2022-jp) either instead of or after
&dquot;iso-8859-1&dquot;.


<sect2>sendmail<label id="sendmail">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;/sw/sbin/sendmail -oem -oi&dquot;

<p>
Specifies the program and arguments used to deliver mail sent by Mutt.
Mutt expects that the specified program interprets additional
arguments as recipient addresses.


<sect2>sendmail&lowbar;wait<label id="sendmail_wait">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 0

<p>
Specifies the number of seconds to wait for the ``<ref id="sendmail" name="&dollar;sendmail">'' process
to finish before giving up and putting delivery in the background.
<p>
Mutt interprets the value of this variable as follows:

<descrip>
<tag>&gt;0 </tag>number of seconds to wait for sendmail to finish before continuing
<tag>0  </tag>wait forever for sendmail to finish
<tag>&lt;0 </tag>always put sendmail in the background without waiting
</descrip>

<p>
Note that if you specify a value other than 0, the output of the child
process will be put in a temporary file.  If there is some error, you
will be informed as to where to find the output.


<sect2>shell<label id="shell">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Command to use when spawning a subshell.  By default, the user's login
shell from /etc/passwd is used.


<sect2>save&lowbar;unsubscribed<label id="save_unsubscribed">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When <em>set</em>, info about unsubscribed newsgroups will be saved into
``newsrc'' file and into cache.


<sect2>show&lowbar;new&lowbar;news<label id="show_new_news">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If <em>set</em>, newsserver will be asked for new newsgroups on entering
the browser.  Otherwise, it will be done only once for a newsserver.
Also controls whether or not number of new articles of subscribed
newsgroups will be then checked.


<sect2>show&lowbar;only&lowbar;unread<label id="show_only_unread">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If <em>set</em>, only subscribed newsgroups that contain unread articles
will be displayed in browser.


<sect2>sig&lowbar;dashes<label id="sig_dashes">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
If set, a line containing ``-- '' will be inserted before your
``<ref id="signature" name="&dollar;signature">''.  It is <bf>strongly</bf> recommended that you not unset
this variable unless your ``signature'' contains just your name.  The
reason for this is because many software packages use ``-- &bsol;n'' to
detect your signature.  For example, Mutt has the ability to highlight
the signature in a different color in the builtin pager.


<sect2>sig&lowbar;on&lowbar;top<label id="sig_on_top">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, the signature will be included before any quoted or forwarded
text.  It is <bf>strongly</bf> recommended that you do not set this variable
unless you really know what you are doing, and are prepared to take
some heat from netiquette guardians.


<sect2>signature<label id="signature">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&tilde;/.signature&dquot;

<p>
Specifies the filename of your signature, which is appended to all
outgoing messages.   If the filename ends with a pipe (``|''), it is
assumed that filename is a shell command and input should be read from
its stdout.


<sect2>simple&lowbar;search<label id="simple_search">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&tilde;f &percnt;s | &tilde;s &percnt;s&dquot;

<p>
Specifies how Mutt should expand a simple search into a real search
pattern.  A simple search is one that does not contain any of the &tilde;
operators.  See ``<ref id="patterns" name="patterns">'' for more information on search patterns.
<p>
For example, if you simply type joe at a search or limit prompt, Mutt
will automatically expand it to the value specified by this variable.
For the default value it would be:
<p>
&tilde;f joe | &tilde;s joe


<sect2>smart&lowbar;wrap<label id="smart_wrap">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
Controls the display of lines longer than the screen width in the
internal pager. If set, long lines are wrapped at a word boundary.  If
unset, lines are simply wrapped at the screen edge. Also see the
``<ref id="markers" name="&dollar;markers">'' variable.


<sect2>smileys<label id="smileys">
<p>
Type: regular expression<newline>
Default: &dquot;(&gt;From )|(:&lsqb;-^&rsqb;?&lsqb;&rsqb;&lsqb;)(&gt;&lt;}{|/DP&rsqb;)&dquot;

<p>
The <em>pager</em> uses this variable to catch some common false
positives of ``<ref id="quote_regexp" name="&dollar;quote&lowbar;regexp">'', most notably smileys in the beginning
of a line


<sect2>sleep&lowbar;time<label id="sleep_time">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 1

<p>
Specifies time, in seconds, to pause while displaying certain informational
messages, while moving from folder to folder and after expunging
messages from the current folder.  The default is to pause one second, so 
a value of zero for this option suppresses the pause.


<sect2>sort<label id="sort">
<p>
Type: sort order<newline>
Default: date

<p>
Specifies how to sort messages in the <em>index</em> menu.  Valid values
are:
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
   date or date-sent
   date-received
   from
   mailbox-order (unsorted)
   score
   size
   subject
   threads
   to

</verb></tscreen><p>
You may optionally use the reverse- prefix to specify reverse sorting
order (example: set sort=reverse-date-sent).


<sect2>sort&lowbar;alias<label id="sort_alias">
<p>
Type: sort order<newline>
Default: alias

<p>
Specifies how the entries in the `alias' menu are sorted.  The
following are legal values:
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
   address (sort alphabetically by email address)
   alias (sort alphabetically by alias name)
   unsorted (leave in order specified in .muttrc)

</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>sort&lowbar;aux<label id="sort_aux">
<p>
Type: sort order<newline>
Default: date

<p>
When sorting by threads, this variable controls how threads are sorted
in relation to other threads, and how the branches of the thread trees
are sorted.  This can be set to any value that ``<ref id="sort" name="&dollar;sort">'' can, except
threads (in that case, mutt will just use date-sent).  You can also
specify the last- prefix in addition to the reverse- prefix, but last-
must come after reverse-.  The last- prefix causes messages to be
sorted against its siblings by which has the last descendant, using
the rest of sort&lowbar;aux as an ordering.  For instance, set sort&lowbar;aux=last-
date-received would mean that if a new message is received in a
thread, that thread becomes the last one displayed (or the first, if
you have set sort=reverse-threads.) Note: For reversed ``<ref id="sort" name="&dollar;sort">''
order <ref id="sort_aux" name="&dollar;sort&lowbar;aux"> is reversed again (which is not the right thing to do,
but kept to not break any existing configuration setting).


<sect2>sort&lowbar;browser<label id="sort_browser">
<p>
Type: sort order<newline>
Default: subject

<p>
Specifies how to sort entries in the file browser.  By default, the
entries are sorted alphabetically.  Valid values:
<p>

<tscreen><verb>
   alpha (alphabetically)
   date
   size
   unsorted

</verb></tscreen><p>
You may optionally use the reverse- prefix to specify reverse sorting
order (example: set sort&lowbar;browser=reverse-date).


<sect2>sort&lowbar;re<label id="sort_re">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
This variable is only useful when sorting by threads with
``<ref id="strict_threads" name="&dollar;strict&lowbar;threads">'' unset.  In that case, it changes the heuristic
mutt uses to thread messages by subject.  With sort&lowbar;re set, mutt will
only attach a message as the child of another message by subject if
the subject of the child message starts with a substring matching the
setting of ``<ref id="reply_regexp" name="&dollar;reply&lowbar;regexp">''.  With sort&lowbar;re unset, mutt will attach
the message whether or not this is the case, as long as the
non-``<ref id="reply_regexp" name="&dollar;reply&lowbar;regexp">'' parts of both messages are identical.


<sect2>spoolfile<label id="spoolfile">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
If your spool mailbox is in a non-default place where Mutt cannot find
it, you can specify its location with this variable.  Mutt will
automatically set this variable to the value of the environment
variable &dollar;MAIL if it is not set.


<sect2>status&lowbar;chars<label id="status_chars">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;-*&percnt;A&dquot;

<p>
Controls the characters used by the &dquot;&percnt;r&dquot; indicator in
``<ref id="status_format" name="&dollar;status&lowbar;format">''. The first character is used when the mailbox is
unchanged. The second is used when the mailbox has been changed, and
it needs to be resynchronized. The third is used if the mailbox is in
read-only mode, or if the mailbox will not be written when exiting
that mailbox (You can toggle whether to write changes to a mailbox
with the toggle-write operation, bound by default to &dquot;&percnt;&dquot;). The fourth
is used to indicate that the current folder has been opened in attach-
message mode (Certain operations like composing a new mail, replying,
forwarding, etc. are not permitted in this mode).


<sect2>status&lowbar;format<label id="status_format">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;-&percnt;r-Mutt: &percnt;f &lsqb;Msgs:&percnt;?M?&percnt;M/?&percnt;m&percnt;?n? New:&percnt;n?&percnt;?o? Old:&percnt;o?&percnt;?d? Del:&percnt;d?&percnt;?F? Flag:&percnt;F?&percnt;?t? Tag:&percnt;t?&percnt;?p? Post:&percnt;p?&percnt;?b? Inc:&percnt;b?&percnt;?l? &percnt;l?&rsqb;---(&percnt;s/&percnt;S)-&percnt;&gt;-(&percnt;P)---&dquot;

<p>
Controls the format of the status line displayed in the <em>index</em>
menu.  This string is similar to ``<ref id="index_format" name="&dollar;index&lowbar;format">'', but has its own
set of printf()-like sequences:
<p>

<descrip>
<tag>&percnt;b  </tag>number of mailboxes with new mail *
<tag>&percnt;d  </tag>number of deleted messages *
<tag>&percnt;f  </tag>the full pathname of the current mailbox
<tag>&percnt;F  </tag>number of flagged messages *
<tag>&percnt;h  </tag>local hostname
<tag>&percnt;l  </tag>size (in bytes) of the current mailbox *
<tag>&percnt;L  </tag>size (in bytes) of the messages shown 
(i.e., which match the current limit) *
<tag>&percnt;m  </tag>the number of messages in the mailbox *
<tag>&percnt;M  </tag>the number of messages shown (i.e., which match the current limit) *
<tag>&percnt;n  </tag>number of new messages in the mailbox *
<tag>&percnt;o  </tag>number of old unread messages
<tag>&percnt;p  </tag>number of postponed messages *
<tag>&percnt;P  </tag>percentage of the way through the index
<tag>&percnt;r  </tag>modified/read-only/won't-write/attach-message indicator,
according to <ref id="status_chars" name="&dollar;status&lowbar;chars">
<tag>&percnt;s  </tag>current sorting mode (<ref id="sort" name="&dollar;sort">)
<tag>&percnt;S  </tag>current aux sorting method (<ref id="sort_aux" name="&dollar;sort&lowbar;aux">)
<tag>&percnt;t  </tag>number of tagged messages *
<tag>&percnt;u  </tag>number of unread messages *
<tag>&percnt;v  </tag>Mutt version string
<tag>&percnt;V  </tag>currently active limit pattern, if any *
<tag>&percnt;&gt;X </tag>right justify the rest of the string and pad with &dquot;X&dquot;
<tag>&percnt;|X </tag>pad to the end of the line with &dquot;X&dquot;
</descrip>

<p>
* = can be optionally printed if nonzero
<p>
Some of the above sequences can be used to optionally print a string
if their value is nonzero.  For example, you may only want to see the
number of flagged messages if such messages exist, since zero is not
particularly meaningful.  To optionally print a string based upon one
of the above sequences, the following construct is used
<p>
&percnt;?&lt;sequence&lowbar;char&gt;?&lt;optional&lowbar;string&gt;?
<p>
where <em>sequence&lowbar;char</em> is a character from the table above, and
<em>optional&lowbar;string</em> is the string you would like printed if
<em>status&lowbar;char</em> is nonzero.  <em>optional&lowbar;string</em> <bf>may</bf> contain
other sequence as well as normal text, but you may <bf>not</bf> nest
optional strings.
<p>
Here is an example illustrating how to optionally print the number of
new messages in a mailbox:
&percnt;?n?&percnt;n new messages.?
<p>
Additionally you can switch between two strings, the first one, if a
value is zero, the second one, if the value is nonzero, by using the
following construct:
&percnt;?&lt;sequence&lowbar;char&gt;?&lt;if&lowbar;string&gt;&amp;&lt;else&lowbar;string&gt;?
<p>
You can additionally force the result of any printf-like sequence to
be lowercase by prefixing the sequence character with an underscore
(&lowbar;) sign.  For example, if you want to display the local hostname in
lowercase, you would use:
&percnt;&lowbar;h
<p>
If you prefix the sequence character with a colon (:) character, mutt
will replace any dots in the expansion by underscores. This might be helpful 
with IMAP folders that don't like dots in folder names.


<sect2>status&lowbar;on&lowbar;top<label id="status_on_top">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
Setting this variable causes the ``status bar'' to be displayed on
the first line of the screen rather than near the bottom.


<sect2>strict&lowbar;threads<label id="strict_threads">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If set, threading will only make use of the ``In-Reply-To'' and
``References'' fields when you ``<ref id="sort" name="&dollar;sort">'' by message threads.  By
default, messages with the same subject are grouped together in
``pseudo threads.''  This may not always be desirable, such as in a
personal mailbox where you might have several unrelated messages with
the subject ``hi'' which will get grouped together.


<sect2>suspend<label id="suspend">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When <em>unset</em>, mutt won't stop when the user presses the terminal's
<em>susp</em> key, usually ``control-Z''. This is useful if you run mutt
inside an xterm using a command like xterm -e mutt.


<sect2>text&lowbar;flowed<label id="text_flowed">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set, mutt will generate text/plain; format=flowed attachments.
This format is easier to handle for some mailing software, and generally
just looks like ordinary text.  To actually make use of this format's 
features, you'll need support in your editor.
<p>
Note that <ref id="indent_string" name="&dollar;indent&lowbar;string"> is ignored when this option is set.


<sect2>thread&lowbar;received<label id="thread_received">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set, mutt uses the date received rather than the date sent
to thread messages by subject.


<sect2>thorough&lowbar;search<label id="thorough_search">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
Affects the <em>&tilde;b</em> and <em>&tilde;h</em> search operations described in
section ``<ref id="patterns" name="patterns">'' above.  If set, the headers and attachments of
messages to be searched are decoded before searching.  If unset,
messages are searched as they appear in the folder.


<sect2>tilde<label id="tilde">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
When set, the internal-pager will pad blank lines to the bottom of the
screen with a tilde (&tilde;).


<sect2>timeout<label id="timeout">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 600

<p>
This variable controls the <em>number of seconds</em> Mutt will wait
for a key to be pressed in the main menu before timing out and
checking for new mail.  A value of zero or less will cause Mutt
to never time out.


<sect2>tmpdir<label id="tmpdir">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
This variable allows you to specify where Mutt will place its
temporary files needed for displaying and composing messages.  If
this variable is not set, the environment variable TMPDIR is
used.  If TMPDIR is not set then &dquot;/tmp&dquot; is used.


<sect2>to&lowbar;chars<label id="to_chars">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot; +TCFL&dquot;

<p>
Controls the character used to indicate mail addressed to you.  The
first character is the one used when the mail is NOT addressed to your
address (default: space).  The second is used when you are the only
recipient of the message (default: +).  The third is when your address
appears in the TO header field, but you are not the only recipient of
the message (default: T).  The fourth character is used when your
address is specified in the CC header field, but you are not the only
recipient.  The fifth character is used to indicate mail that was sent
by <em>you</em>.  The sixth character is used to indicate when a mail
was sent to a mailing-list you subscribe to (default: L).


<sect2>trash<label id="trash">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
If set, this variable specifies the path of the trash folder where the
mails marked for deletion will be moved, instead of being irremediably
purged.
<p>
NOTE: When you delete a message in the trash folder, it is really
deleted, so that you have a way to clean the trash.


<sect2>tunnel<label id="tunnel">
<p>
Type: string<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Setting this variable will cause mutt to open a pipe to a command
instead of a raw socket. You may be able to use this to set up
preauthenticated connections to your IMAP/POP3 server. Example:
<p>
tunnel=&dquot;ssh -q mailhost.net /usr/local/libexec/imapd&dquot;
<p>
NOTE: For this example to work you must be able to log in to the remote
machine without having to enter a password.


<sect2>use&lowbar;8bitmime<label id="use_8bitmime">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
<bf>Warning:</bf> do not set this variable unless you are using a version
of sendmail which supports the -B8BITMIME flag (such as sendmail
8.8.x) or you may not be able to send mail.
<p>
When <em>set</em>, Mutt will invoke ``<ref id="sendmail" name="&dollar;sendmail">'' with the -B8BITMIME
flag when sending 8-bit messages to enable ESMTP negotiation.


<sect2>use&lowbar;domain<label id="use_domain">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When set, Mutt will qualify all local addresses (ones without the
@host portion) with the value of ``<ref id="hostname" name="&dollar;hostname">''.  If <em>unset</em>, no
addresses will be qualified.


<sect2>use&lowbar;from<label id="use_from">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When <em>set</em>, Mutt will generate the `From:' header field when
sending messages.  If <em>unset</em>, no `From:' header field will be
generated unless the user explicitly sets one using the ``<ref id="my_hdr" name="my&lowbar;hdr">''
command.


<sect2>use&lowbar;ipv6<label id="use_ipv6">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When <em>set</em>, Mutt will look for IPv6 addresses of hosts it tries to
contact.  If this option is unset, Mutt will restrict itself to IPv4 addresses.
Normally, the default should work.


<sect2>user&lowbar;agent<label id="user_agent">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When <em>set</em>, mutt will add a &dquot;User-Agent&dquot; header to outgoing
messages, indicating which version of mutt was used for composing
them.


<sect2>visual<label id="visual">
<p>
Type: path<newline>
Default: &dquot;&dquot;

<p>
Specifies the visual editor to invoke when the <em>&tilde;v</em> command is
given in the builtin editor.


<sect2>wait&lowbar;key<label id="wait_key">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
Controls whether Mutt will ask you to press a key after <em>shell-
escape</em>, <em>pipe-message</em>, <em>pipe-entry</em>, <em>print-message</em>,
and <em>print-entry</em> commands.
<p>
It is also used when viewing attachments with ``<ref id="auto_view" name="auto&lowbar;view">'', provided
that the corresponding mailcap entry has a <em>needsterminal</em> flag,
and the external program is interactive.
<p>
When set, Mutt will always ask for a key. When unset, Mutt will wait
for a key only if the external command returned a non-zero status.


<sect2>weed<label id="weed">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
When set, mutt will weed headers when when displaying, forwarding,
printing, or replying to messages.


<sect2>wrap&lowbar;search<label id="wrap_search">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>
Controls whether searches wrap around the end of the mailbox.
<p>
When set, searches will wrap around the first (or last) message. When
unset, searches will not wrap.


<sect2>wrapmargin<label id="wrapmargin">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 0

<p>
Controls the size of the margin remaining at the right side of
the terminal when mutt's pager does smart wrapping.


<sect2>write&lowbar;inc<label id="write_inc">
<p>
Type: number<newline>
Default: 10

<p>
When writing a mailbox, a message will be printed every
<em>write&lowbar;inc</em> messages to indicate progress.  If set to 0, only a
single message will be displayed before writing a mailbox.
<p>
Also see the ``<ref id="read_inc" name="&dollar;read&lowbar;inc">'' variable.


<sect2>write&lowbar;bcc<label id="write_bcc">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: yes

<p>

messages to be sent.  Exim users may wish to use this.


<sect2>x&lowbar;comment&lowbar;to<label id="x_comment_to">
<p>
Type: boolean<newline>
Default: no

<p>
If <em>set</em>, Mutt will add ``X-Comment-To:'' field (that contains full

<sect1>Functions<label id="functions">
<p>
The following is the list of available functions listed by the mapping
in which they are available.  The default key setting is given, and an
explanation of what the function does.  The key bindings of these
functions can be changed with the <ref name="bind" id="bind">
command.

<sect2>generic
<p>

The <em/generic/ menu is not a real menu, but specifies common functions
(such as movement) available in all menus except for <em/pager/ and
<em/editor/.  Changing settings for this menu will affect the default
bindings for all menus (except as noted).
