    <para>
      <emphasis role="bold">Mutt-ng</emphasis> is a small but very
      powerful text-based MIME mail client.  Mutt-ng is highly
      configurable, and is well suited to the mail power user with
      advanced features like key bindings, keyboard macros, mail
      threading, regular expression searches and a powerful pattern
      matching language for selecting groups of messages.

    <para>
      This documentation additionally contains documentation to
      <emphasis role="bold"> Mutt-NG </emphasis> ,a fork from Mutt
      with the goal to fix all the little annoyances of Mutt, to
      integrate all the Mutt patches that are floating around in the
      web, and to add other new features. Features specific to Mutt-ng
      will be discussed in an extra section. Don't be confused when
      most of the documentation talk about Mutt and not Mutt-ng,
      Mutt-ng contains all Mutt features, plus many more.

      <para>
        Mutt-ng offers great flexibility due to the use of functions:
        internally, every action a user can make mutt-ng perform is named
        ``function.'' Those functions are assigned to keys (or even key
        sequences) and may be completely adjusted to user's needs. The
        basic idea is that the impatient users get a very intuitive
        interface to start off with and advanced users virtually get no
        limits to adjustments.

          <listitem>
            
            <para>
              There is one dedicated line on the screen used to query
              the user for input, issue any command, query variables and
              display error and informational messages. As for every type of
              user input, this requires manual action leading to the need of
              input.

              performed at well-defined situations: what to do when entering
              which folder, what to do when displaying or replying to what
              kind of message, etc. These are optional, i.e. a user doesn't

      <para>
        Although mutt-ng has many functionality built-in, many
        features can be delegated to external tools to increase
        flexibility: users can define programs to filter a message through
        before displaying, users can use any program they want for
        displaying a message, message types (such as PDF or PostScript)
        for which mutt-ng doesn't have a built-in filter can be rendered
        by arbitrary tools and so forth. Although mutt-ng has an alias
        mechanism built-in, it features using external tools to query for
        nearly every type of addresses from sources like LDAP, databases
        or just the list of locally known users.

      <title>Index</title>
      
      <para>
        The index is the screen that you usually see first when you
        start mutt-ng. It gives an overview over your emails in the
        currently opened mailbox. By default, this is your system mailbox.
        The information you see in the index is a list of emails, each with
        its number on the left, its flags (new email, important email,
        email that has been forwarded or replied to, tagged email, ...),
        the date when email was sent, its sender, the email size, and the
        subject. Additionally, the index also shows thread hierarchies:
        when you reply to an email, and the other person replies back, you
        can see the other's person email in a "sub-tree" below.  This is
        especially useful for personal email between a group of people or
        when you've subscribed to mailing lists.

        The pager is responsible for showing the email content. On the
        top of the pager you have an overview over the most important email
        headers like the sender, the recipient, the subject, and much more
        information. How much information you actually see depends on your
        configuration, which we'll describe below.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Below the headers, you see the email body which usually contains
        the message. If the email contains any attachments, you will see
        more information about them below the email body, or, if the
        attachments are text files, you can view them directly in the
        pager.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        To give the user a good overview, it is possible to configure
        mutt-ng to show different things in the pager with different
        colors. Virtually everything that can be described with a regular
        expression can be colored, e.g. URLs, email addresses or smileys.

        The file browser is the interface to the local or remote

        custom sorting of items, limiting the items shown by a regular
        expression and a freely adjustable format of what to display in
        which way. It also allows for easy navigation through the
        file system when selecting file(s) to attach to a message, select
        multiple files to attach and many more.

        The sidebar comes in handy to manage mails which are spread
        over different folders. All folders users setup mutt-ng to watch
        for new mail will be listed. The listing includes not only the
        name but also the number of total messages, the number of new and
        flagged messages. Items with new mail may be colored different
        from those with flagged mail, items may be shortened or compress

        The help screen is meant to offer a quick help to the user. It
        lists the current configuration of key bindings and their
        associated commands including a short description, and currently
        unbound functions that still need to be associated with a key
        binding (or alternatively, they can be called via the mutt-ng
        command prompt).

        The compose menu features a split screen containing the
        information which really matter before actually sending a
        message by mail or posting an article to a newsgroup: who gets
        the message as what (recipient, newsgroup, who gets what kind of
        copy). Additionally, users may set security options like
        deciding whether to sign, encrypt or sign and encrypt a message
        with/for what keys.

      <para>

      <para>
        The alias menu is used to help users finding the recipients
        of messages. For users who need to contact many people, there's
        no need to remember addresses or names completely because it
        allows for searching, too. The alias mechanism and thus the
        alias menu also features grouping several addresses by a shorter
        nickname, the actual alias, so that users don't have to select
        each single recipient manually.

        As will be later discussed in detail, mutt-ng features a good
        and stable MIME implementation, that is, is greatly supports
        sending and receiving messages of arbitrary type. The
        attachment menu displays a message's structure in detail: what
        content parts are attached to which parent part (which gives a
        true tree structure), which type is of what type and what size.
        Single parts may saved, deleted or modified to offer great and
        easy access to message's internals.

        By default, Mutt-ng uses its builtin pager to display the body of

        The pager is very similar to the Unix program <emphasis>less</emphasis> though not nearly as
        featureful.

      </para>
      
      <para>
        In addition, many of the functions from the <emphasis>index</emphasis> are available in
        the pager, such as <emphasis>delete-message</emphasis> or <emphasis>
          copy-message
        </emphasis>
        (this is one
        advantage over using an external pager to view messages).
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Also, the internal pager supports a couple other advanced features.
        For
        one, it will accept and translate the ``standard'' nroff sequences
        forbold and underline. These sequences are a series of either the
        letter,
        backspace (^H), the letter again for bold or the letter,
        backspace,
        ``_'' for denoting underline. Mutt-ng will attempt to display
        these
        in bold and underline respectively if your terminal supports them. If
        not, you can use the bold and underline <muttng-doc:command name="color"/>
        objects to specify a color or mono attribute for them.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Additionally, the internal pager supports the ANSI escape
        sequences for character attributes.  Mutt-ng translates them
        into the correct color and character settings.  The sequences
        Mutt-ng supports are: <literal>ESC [ Ps;Ps;Ps;...;Ps
          m</literal> (see table below for possible values for
        <literal>Ps</literal>).

          MIME tagging.  Technically, this function will temporarily change
          the MIME content types of the body parts containing PGP data; this

        <para>
          This command (available in the ``index'' and ``pager'') allows you to
          edit the raw current message as it's present in the mail folder.
          After you have finished editing, the changed message will be
          appended to the current folder, and the original message will be
          marked for deletion.

        </para>
        
        <para>
          This command is used to temporarily edit an attachment's content
          type to fix, for instance, bogus character set parameters.  When
          invoked from the index or from the pager, you'll have the
          opportunity to edit the top-level attachment's content type.  On the
          <link linkend="attach-menu">attach-menu</link>, you can change any
          attachment's content type. These changes are not persistent, and get
          lost upon changing folders.

        <para>
          Note that this command is also available on the <link linkend="compose-menu">compose-menu</link>

          This command is used to execute any command you would normally put in
          a
          configuration file.  A common use is to check the settings of
          variables, or
          in conjunction with <muttng-doc:command name="macro"/> to change

          header(s) if the
          <muttng-doc:varref name="honor-followup-to"/>
          configuration variable is set.  Using this when replying to messages
          posted

          the message you are replying to.

        <para>
          With resend-message, mutt takes the current message as a template for
          a
          new message.  This function is best described as "recall from
          arbitrary
          folders".  It can conveniently be used to forward MIME messages while
          preserving the original mail structure. Note that the amount of
          headers
          included here depends on the value of the <muttng-doc:varref name="weed"/>
          variable.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          This function is also available from the attachment menu. You can use
          this
          to easily resend a message which was included with a bounce message
          as a message/rfc822 body part.

          Asks for an external Unix command and executes it.  The
          <muttng-doc:varref name="wait-key"/>
          can be used to control
          whether Mutt-ng will wait for a key to be pressed when the command
          returns
          (presumably to let the user read the output of the command), based on
          the return status of the named command.

        <para>
          The <emphasis>pager</emphasis> uses the
          <muttng-doc:varref name="quote-regexp"/>
          variable to detect quoted text when
          displaying the body of the message.  This function toggles the
          displayof the quoted material in the message.  It is particularly
          useful when
          are interested in just the response and there is a large amount of
          quoted text in the way.

          If you don't set your preferred editor in your configuration, mutt-ng
          first looks whether the environment variable <muttng-doc:envvar name="VISUAL"/> is set, and if
          so, it takes its value as editor command. Otherwise, it has a look
          at <muttng-doc:envvar name="EDITOR"/> and takes its value if it is set. If no
          editor command
          can be found, mutt-ng simply assumes <muttng-doc:man name="vi"/> to be the
          default editor,
          since it's the most widespread editor in the Unix world and it's
          pretty
          safe to assume that it is installed and available.

        <para>
          When you've finished entering your message, save it and quit your 
          editor. Mutt-ng will then present you with a summary screen, the
          compose menu. 
          On the top, you see a summary of the most important available key
          commands.
          Below that, you see the sender, the recipient(s), Cc and/or Bcc 
          recipient(s), the subject, the reply-to address, and optionally
          information where the sent email will be stored and whether it should
          be digitally signed and/or encrypted.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Below that, you see a list of "attachments". The mail you've just
          entered before is also an attachment, but due to its special type
          (it's plain text), it will be displayed as the normal message on
          the receiver's side.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          At this point, you can add more attachments, pressing <literal>a</literal>, you
          can edit the recipient addresses, pressing <literal>t</literal> for
          the "To:" field,
          <literal>c</literal> for the "Cc:" field, and <literal>b</literal>
          for the "Bcc: field. You can
          also edit the subject the subject by simply pressing <literal>s</literal> or the
          email message that you've entered before by pressing <literal>e</literal>. You will
          then again return to the editor. You can even edit the sender, by
          pressing
          <literal>&lt;esc&gt;f</literal>, but this shall only be used with
          caution.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Alternatively, you can configure mutt-ng in a way that most of the
          above settings can be edited using the editor. Therefore, you only
          need to add the following to your configuration:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
set edit_headers</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Once you have finished editing the body of your mail message, you are
          returned to the <emphasis>compose</emphasis> menu.  The following
          options are available:

            You can start editing the email message. It is strongly
            recommended to put your answer <emphasis>below</emphasis> the
            quoted text and to
            only quote what is really necessary and that you refer to. Putting
            your answer on top of the quoted message, is, although very
            widespread, very often not considered to be a polite way to answer
            emails.

            The quote attribution is configurable, by default it is set to
            
            <screen>
set attribution = "On %d, %n wrote:"</screen>
            
          </para>
          
          <para>
            It can also be set to something more compact, e.g.
            
            <screen>
set attribution = "attribution="* %n &lt;%a&gt; [%(%y-%m-%d %H:%M)]:"</screen>
            
          </para>

            The example above results in the following attribution:

            Generally, try to keep your attribution short yet

            If any of the regular expression matches, a mailing

          Mutt-ng will not ask you any questions about keys which have a
          certified user ID matching one of the message recipients' mail
          addresses.  However, there may be situations in which there are

        <para>
          In these cases, you are dropped into a menu with a list of keys from
          which you can select one.  When you quit this menu, or mutt can't
          find any matching keys, you are prompted for a user ID.  You can, as
          usually, abort this prompt using <literal>^G</literal>.  When
          you do so, mutt will
          return to the compose screen.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Once you have successfully finished the key selection, the message
          will be encrypted using the selected public keys, and sent out.

        <para>
          Most fields of the entries in the key selection menu (see also

          have obvious meanings.  But some explanations on the capabilities,

        <para>
          The capabilities field (%c) expands to a two-character
          sequencerepresenting a key's capabilities.  The first character gives
          the key's encryption capabilities: A minus sign (<emphasis role="bold">
            -
          </emphasis>
          )means 
          that the key cannot be used for encryption.  A dot (<emphasis role="bold">
            .
          </emphasis>
          )means that
          it's marked as a signature key in one of the user IDs, but may 
          also be used for encryption.  The letter <emphasis role="bold">e</emphasis> indicates that 
          this key can be used for encryption.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          The second character indicates the key's signing capabilities.  Once 
          again, a ``<emphasis role="bold">-</emphasis>'' implies ``not for
          signing'', ``<emphasis role="bold">.</emphasis>'' implies
          that the key is marked as an encryption key in one of the user-ids,
          and
          ``<emphasis role="bold">s</emphasis>'' denotes a key which can be
          used for signing.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Finally, the validity field (%t) indicates how well-certified
          a user-id
          is.  A question mark (<emphasis role="bold">?</emphasis>) indicates
          undefined validity, a minus 
          character (<emphasis role="bold">-</emphasis>) marks an untrusted
          association, a space character 
          means a partially trusted association, and a plus character (<emphasis role="bold">
            +
          </emphasis>
          )
          indicates complete validity.

        <para>
          You may also have configured mutt to co-operate with Mixmaster, an
          anonymous remailer.  Mixmaster permits you to send your messages
          anonymously using a chain of remailers. Mixmaster support in mutt is
          for 
          mixmaster version 2.04 (beta 45 appears to be the latest) and 2.03. 
          It does not support earlier versions or the later so-called version 3
          betas, 
          of which the latest appears to be called 2.9b23.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          To use it, you'll have to obey certain restrictions.  Most
          important, you cannot use the <literal>Cc</literal> and <literal>Bcc</literal> headers.  To tell
          Mutt-ng to use mixmaster, you have to select a remailer chain, using
          the mix function on the compose menu.  
        </para>
        
        <para>
          The chain selection screen is divided into two parts.  In the
          (larger) upper part, you get a list of remailers you may use.  In
          the lower part, you see the currently selected chain of remailers.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          You can navigate in the chain using the <literal>chain-prev</literal>
          and
          <literal>chain-next</literal> functions, which are by default bound
          to the left
          and right arrows and to the <literal>h</literal> and <literal>l</literal> keys (think vi
          keyboard bindings).  To insert a remailer at the current chain
          position, use the <literal>insert</literal> function.  To append a
          remailer behind
          the current chain position, use <literal>select-entry</literal> or <literal>
            append
          </literal>
          .
          You can also delete entries from the chain, using the corresponding
          function.  Finally, to abandon your changes, leave the menu, or
          <literal>accept</literal> them pressing (by default) the <literal>
            Return
          </literal>
          key.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Note that different remailers do have different capabilities,
          indicated in the <literal>%c</literal> entry of the remailer menu lines (see
          <muttng-doc:varref name="mix-entry-format"/>).
          Most important is
          the ``middleman'' capability, indicated by a capital ``M'': This
          means that the remailer in question cannot be used as the final
          element of a chain, but will only forward messages to other
          mixmaster remailers.  For details on the other capabilities, please
          have a look at the mixmaster documentation.

      <title>Forwarding and Bouncing Mail</title>
      
      <para>
        Often, it is necessary to forward mails to other people.
        Therefore, mutt-ng supports forwarding messages in two different
        ways.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The first one is regular forwarding, as you probably know it from
        other mail clients. You simply press <literal>f</literal>, enter the
        recipient
        email address, the subject of the forwarded email, and then you can
        edit the message to be forwarded in the editor. The forwarded
        message is separated from the rest of the message via the two
        following markers:
      </para>
      
      <para>
        
        <screen>
----- Forwarded message from Lucas User &#60;luser@example.com&#62; -----

From: Lucas User &#60;luser@example.com&#62;

To: Michael Random &#60;mrandom@example.com&#62;
Subject: Re: blackmail

a horrible death.

----- End forwarded message -----</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        When you're done with editing the mail, save and quit the editor,
        and you will return to the compose menu, the same menu you also
        encounter when composing or replying to mails.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The second mode of forwarding emails with mutt-ng is the
        so-called <emphasis>bouncing</emphasis>: when you bounce an email to
        another
        address, it will be sent in practically the same format you send it
        (except for headers that are created during transporting the
        message). To bounce a message, press <literal>b</literal> and enter the
        recipient
        email address. By default, you are then asked whether you really
        want to bounce the message to the specified recipient. If you answer
        with yes, the message will then be bounced.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        To the recipient, the bounced email will look as if he got it
        like a regular email where he was <literal>Bcc:</literal> recipient.
        The only
        possibility to find out whether it was a bounced email is to
        carefully study the email headers and to find out which host really
        sent the email.
      </para>

    <sect1 id="postponing-mail">
      <title>Postponing Mail</title>
      
      <para>
        At times it is desirable to delay sending a message that you have
        already begun to compose.  When the <emphasis>postpone-message</emphasis> function is
        used in the <emphasis>compose</emphasis> menu, the body of your message
        and attachments
        are stored in the mailbox specified by the
        <muttng-doc:varref name="postponed"/> variable.  This means that you can recall the
        message even if you exit Mutt-ng and then restart it at a later time.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Once a message is postponed, there are several ways to resume it.  From
        the
        command line you can use the ``-p'' option, or if you <emphasis>compose</emphasis> a new
        message from the <emphasis>index</emphasis> or <emphasis>pager</emphasis> you will be prompted if postponed
        messages exist.  If multiple messages are currently postponed, the
        <emphasis>postponed</emphasis> menu will pop up and you can select
        which message you would
        like to resume.

        <emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> If you postpone a reply to a
        message, the reply setting of
        the message is only updated when you actually finish the message and

        replied to for the status of the message to be updated.

        While the default configuration (or ``preferences'') make Mutt-ng
        usable right out
        of the box, it is often desirable to tailor Mutt-ng to suit your own
        tastes. When
        Mutt-ng is first invoked, it will attempt to read the ``system''
        configuration
        file (defaults set by your local system administrator), unless the
        ``-n'' <link linkend="commandline">commandline</link> option is
        specified.  This file is
        typically <literal>/usr/local/share/muttng/Muttngrc</literal> or <literal>

        in your home directory, Mutt-ng will look for <literal>.muttngrc</literal>.  If this file

      <title>Basic Syntax of Initialization Files</title>
      
      <para>
        An initialization file consists of a series of <link linkend="commands">commands</link>. Each line of the file may contain one or more commands.
        When multiple commands are used, they must be separated by a semicolon

        The hash mark, or pound sign
        (``#''), is used as a ``comment'' character. You can use it to
        annotate your initialization file. All text after the comment character
        to the end of the line is ignored. For example,
      </para>

      <para>
        Single quotes (') and double quotes (&quot;) can be used to quote
        strings
        which contain spaces or other special characters.  The difference
        between
        the two types of quotes is similar to that of many popular shell
        programs,
        namely that a single quote is used to specify a literal string (one
        that is
        not interpreted for shell variables or quoting with a backslash
        (see
        next paragraph), while double quotes indicate a string for which
        should be evaluated.  For example, backtics are evaluated inside of
        double
        quotes, but <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> for single quotes.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        \ quotes the next character, just as in shells such as bash and
        zsh.
        For example, if want to put quotes ``&quot;'' inside of a string, you
        can use
        ``\'' to force the next character to be a literal instead of
        interpreted
        character.

      <para>
        ``\\'' means to insert a literal ``\'' into the line.
        ``\n'' and ``\r'' have their usual C meanings of linefeed and
        carriage-return, respectively.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        A \ at the end of a line can be used to split commands over
        multiple lines, provided that the split points don't appear in the
        middle of command names.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Please note that, unlike the various shells, mutt-ng interprets a
        ``\''
        at the end of a line also in comments. This allows you to disable a
        command
        split over multiple lines with only one ``#''.

        When testing your config files, beware the following caveat. The
        backslash
        at the end of the commented line extends the current line with the next
        line
        - then referred to as a ``continuation line''.  As the first line is
        commented with a hash (#) all following continuation lines are also
        part of a comment and therefore are ignored, too. So take care of
        comments
        when continuation lines are involved within your setup files!

          It is possible to substitute the output of a Unix command in an
          initialization file.  This is accomplished by enclosing the command
          in backquotes (``) as in, for example:

        <para>
          The output of the Unix command ``uname -a'' will be substituted
          before the line is parsed. Note that since initialization files are

          Mutt-ng flexibly allows users to define their own variables. To
          avoid conflicts with the standard set and to prevent misleading
          error messages, there's a reserved namespace for them: all
          user-defined variables must be prefixed with <literal>user_</literal> and can be
          used just like any ordinary configuration or environment
          variable.
        </para>

          For example, to view the manual, users can either define two
          macros like the following

          In order to allow users to share one setup over a number of

          Please note that by the type of quoting, muttng determines when
          to expand these values: when it finds double quotes, the value will
          be expanded during reading the setup files but when it finds single
          quotes, it'll expand it at runtime as needed.

        <para>
          will be executed at runtime because of the single quotes so that

        It's usually very cumbersome to remember or type out the address of
        someone
        you are communicating with.  Mutt-ng allows you to create ``aliases''
        which map
        a short string to a full address.

      </para>
      
      <para>
        Unlike other mailers, Mutt-ng doesn't require aliases to be defined
        in a special file.  The <literal>alias</literal> command can appear
        anywhere in
        a configuration file, as long as this file is <muttng-doc:command name="source"/>.
        Consequently, you can have multiple alias files, or
        you can have all aliases defined in your muttrc.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        On the other hand, the <muttng-doc:funcref name="create-alias"/>
        function can use only one file, the one pointed to by the
        <muttng-doc:varref name="alias-file"/>
        variable (which is
        <literal>~/.muttrc</literal> by default). This file is not
        special either,
        in the sense that Mutt-ng will happily append aliases to any file, but
        in
        order for the new aliases to take effect you need to explicitly <muttng-doc:command name="source"/>
        this file too.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        For example:
      </para>
      
      <para>
        
        <screen>
source /usr/local/share/Mutt-ng.aliases
source ~/.mail_aliases
set alias_file=~/.mail_aliases</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        To use aliases, you merely use the alias at any place in mutt where
        muttprompts for addresses, such as the <emphasis>To:</emphasis> or <emphasis>
          Cc:
        </emphasis>
        prompt.  You can
        also enter aliases in your editor at the appropriate headers if you
        have the
        <muttng-doc:varref name="editor-headers"/>
        variable set.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        In addition, at the various address prompts, you can use the tab
        character
        to expand a partial alias to the full alias.  If there are multiple
        matches,
        mutt will bring up a menu with the matching aliases.  In order to be
        presented with the full list of aliases, you must hit tab with out a
        partial
        alias, such as at the beginning of the prompt or after a comma denoting
        multiple addresses.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        In the alias menu, you can select as many aliases as you want with the
        <emphasis>select-entry</emphasis> key (default: RET), and use the <emphasis>
          exit
        </emphasis>
        key
        (default: q) to return to the address prompt.

        <emphasis>key</emphasis> is the key (or key sequence) you wish to bind.
         To specify a
        control character, use the sequence <emphasis>\Cx</emphasis>,
        where <emphasis>x</emphasis> is the
        letter of the control character (for example, to specify control-A use
        ``\Ca'').  Note that the case of <emphasis>x</emphasis> as well as
        <emphasis>\C</emphasis> is
        ignored, so that <emphasis>\CA</emphasis>, <emphasis>\Ca</emphasis>, <emphasis>
          \cA
        </emphasis>
        and <emphasis>\ca</emphasis> are all
        equivalent.  An alternative form is to specify the key as a three digit
        octal number prefixed with a ``\'' (for example <emphasis>
          \177
        </emphasis>
        is

        The <muttng-doc:hook name="iconv"/> command defines a system-specific

        for character sets.

      <para>
        It is often desirable to change settings based on which mailbox you are
        reading.  The <muttng-doc:hook name="folder"/> command provides a method by which you can
        execute
        any configuration command.  <emphasis>regexp</emphasis> is a regular
        expression specifying
        in which mailboxes to execute <emphasis>command</emphasis> before
        loading.  If a mailbox
        matches multiple <muttng-doc:hook name="folder"/>'s, they are executed in the order given in
        the
        muttrc.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> if you use the ``!'' shortcut
        for <muttng-doc:varref name="spoolfile"/> at the beginning of the
        pattern, you must place it
        inside of double or single quotes in order to distinguish it from the
        logical <emphasis>not</emphasis> operator for the expression.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Note that the settings are <emphasis>not</emphasis> restored when you
        leave the mailbox.
        For example, a command action to perform is to change the sorting
        methodbased upon the mailbox being read:
      </para>
      
      <para>
        
        <screen>
folder-hook mutt set sort=threads</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        However, the sorting method is not restored to its previous value when
        reading a different mailbox.  To specify a <emphasis>default</emphasis>
        command, use the
        pattern ``.'':
      </para>
      
      <para>
        
        <screen>

        Macros are useful when you would like a single key to perform a series

        actions.  When you press <emphasis>key</emphasis> in menu <emphasis>
          menu
        </emphasis>
        ,Mutt-ng will behave as if
        you had typed <emphasis>sequence</emphasis>.  So if you have a common
        sequence of commands
        you type, you can create a macro to execute those commands with a
        singlekey.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        <emphasis>menu</emphasis> is the <link linkend="maps">maps</link> which

        Multiple maps may be specified by separating multiple menu arguments by
        commas. Whitespace may not be used in between the menu arguments and
        thecommas separating them.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        <emphasis>key</emphasis> and <emphasis>sequence</emphasis> are expanded
        by the same rules as the <muttng-doc:command name="bind"/>.  There are
        some additions however.  The
        first is that control characters in <emphasis>sequence</emphasis> can
        also be specified
        as <emphasis>^x</emphasis>.  In order to get a caret (`^'')
        you need to use
        <emphasis>^^</emphasis>.  Secondly, to specify a certain key
        such as <emphasis>up</emphasis>
        or to invoke a function directly, you can use the format
        <emphasis>&lt;key name&gt;</emphasis> and <emphasis>&lt;function
          name&gt;
        </emphasis>
        .For a listing of key
        names see the section on <muttng-doc:command name="bind"/>.  Functions
        are listed in the <link linkend="functions">functions</link>.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The advantage with using function names directly is that the macros
        willwork regardless of the current key bindings, so they are not
        dependent on
        the user having particular key definitions.  This makes them more
        robustand portable, and also facilitates defining of macros in files
        used by more
        than one user (eg. the system Muttngrc).
      </para>
      
      <para>

      <para>
        Messages often have many header fields added by automatic processing
        systems,
        or which may not seem useful to display on the screen.  This command
        allows
        you to specify header fields which you don't normally want to see.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        You do not need to specify the full header field name.  For example,
        ``ignore content-'' will ignore all header fields that begin with the
        pattern
        ``content-''. ``ignore *'' will ignore all headers.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        To remove a previously added token from the list, use the ``unignore''
        command.
        The ``unignore'' command will make Mutt-ng display headers with the
        given pattern.
        For example, if you do ``ignore x-'' it is possible to ``unignore
        x-mailer''.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        ``unignore *'' will remove all tokens from the ignore list.

        <screen>

      <para>
        With various functions, mutt will treat messages differently,
        depending on whether you sent them or whether you received them from
        someone else.  For instance, when replying to a message that you
        sent to a different party, mutt will automatically suggest to send
        the response to the original message's recipients--responding to
        yourself won't make much sense in many cases.
        (See <muttng-doc:varref name="reply-to"/>.)
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Many users receive e-mail under a number of different addresses. To
        fully use mutt's features here, the program must be able to
        recognize what e-mail addresses you receive mail under. That's the
        purpose of the <literal>alternates</literal> command: It takes a list
        of regular
        expressions, each of which can identify an address under which you
        receive e-mail.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The <literal>unalternates</literal> command can be used to write
        exceptions to
        <literal>alternates</literal> patterns. If an address matches something
        in an
        <literal>alternates</literal> command, but you nonetheless do not think
        it is
        from you, you can list a more precise pattern under an <literal>
          unalternates
        </literal>
        command.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        To remove a regular expression from the <literal>alternates</literal>
        list, use the
        <literal>unalternates</literal> command with exactly the same <emphasis>
          regexp
        </emphasis>
        .
        Likewise, if the <emphasis>regexp</emphasis> for a <literal>alternates</literal> command matches
        an entry on the <literal>unalternates</literal> list, that <literal>
          unalternates
        </literal>
        entry will be removed. If the <emphasis>regexp</emphasis> for <literal>
          unalternates
        </literal>
        is ``*'', <emphasis>all entries</emphasis> on <literal>alternates</literal> will be removed.

          Mutt-ng contains support for so-called <literal>format=flowed</literal> messages.
          In the beginning of email, each message had a fixed line width, and
          it was enough for displaying them on fixed-size terminals. But times
          changed, and nowadays hardly anybody still uses fixed-size terminals:
          more people nowaydays use graphical user interfaces, with dynamically
          resizable windows. This led to the demand of a new email format that
          makes it possible for the email client to make the email look nice
          in a resizable window without breaking quoting levels and creating
          an incompatible email format that can also be displayed nicely on
          old fixed-size terminals.

        <para>
          When you receive emails that are marked as <literal>format=flowed</literal>
          messages, and is formatted correctly, mutt-ng will try to reformat
          the message to optimally fit on your terminal. If you want a fixed
          margin on the right side of your terminal, you can set the
          following:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
set wrapmargin = 10</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          The code above makes the line break 10 columns before the right
          side of the terminal.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          If your terminal is so wide that the lines are embarrassingly long,
          you can also set a maximum line length:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
set max_line_length = 120</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          The example above will give you lines not longer than 120
          characters.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          When you view at <literal>format=flowed</literal> messages, you will
          often see
          the quoting hierarchy like in the following example:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
&gt;Bill, can you please send last month's progress report to Mr. 
&gt;Morgan? We also urgently need the cost estimation for the new 
&gt;production server that we want to set up before our customer's 
&gt;project will go live.</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          This obviously doesn't look very nice, and it makes it very
          hard to differentiate between text and quoting character. The
          solution is to configure mutt-ng to "stuff" the quoting:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
set stuff_quoted</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          This will lead to a nicer result that is easier to read:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>

        <para>
          If you want mutt-ng to send emails with <literal>format=flowed</literal> set, you
          need to explicitly set it:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
set text_flowed</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Additionally, you have to use an editor which supports writing
          <literal>format=flowed</literal>-conforming emails. For <muttng-doc:man name="vim"/>, this is
          done by
          adding <literal>w</literal> to the formatoptions (see <literal>:h
            formatoptions
          </literal>
          and
          <literal>:h fo-table</literal>) when writing emails.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Also note that <emphasis>format=flowed</emphasis> knows about
          ``space-stuffing'',
          that is, when sending messages, some kinds of lines have to be
          indented with a single space on the sending side. On the receiving
          side, the first space (if any) is removed. As a consequence and in
          addition to the above simple setting, please keep this in mind when
          making manual formattings within the editor. Also note that mutt-ng
          currently violates the standard (<muttng-doc:rfc num="3676"/>) as it does not
          space-stuff lines starting with:
        </para>

          For completeness, the <muttng-doc:varref name="delete-space"/> variable provides the mechanism
          to generate a <literal>DelSp=yes</literal> parameter on <emphasis>
            outgoing
          </emphasis>
          messages.
          According to the standard, clients receiving a <literal>format=flowed</literal>
          messages should delete the last space of a flowed line but still
          interpret the line as flowed. Because flowed lines usually contain
          only one space at the end, this parameter would make the receiving
          client concatenate the last word of the previous with the first of
          the current line <emphasis>without</emphasis> a space. This makes
          ordinary text
          unreadable and is intended for languages rarely using spaces. So
          please use this setting only if you're sure what you're doing.

      <para>
        Mutt-ng has a few nice features for <link linkend="using-lists">using-lists</link>. 
        In order to take advantage of them, you must
        specify which addresses belong to mailing lists, and which mailing
        lists you are subscribed to.  Once you have done this, the
        <link linkend="func-list-reply">list-reply</link>
        function will work for all known lists.
        Additionally, when you send a message to a subscribed list, mutt will
        add a Mail-Followup-To header to tell other users' mail user agents
        not to send copies of replies to your personal address.   Note that
        the Mail-Followup-To header is a non-standard extension which is not
        supported by all mail user agents.  Adding it is not bullet-proof
        against
        receiving personal CCs of list messages.  Also note that the generation
        of the Mail-Followup-To header is controlled by the
        <muttng-doc:varref name="followup-to"/>
        configuration variable.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        More precisely, Mutt-ng maintains lists of patterns for the addresses
        of known and subscribed mailing lists.  Every subscribed mailing
        list is known. To mark a mailing list as known, use the ``lists''
        command.  To mark it as subscribed, use ``subscribe''.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        You can use regular expressions with both commands.  To mark all
        messages sent to a specific bug report's address on mutt's bug
        tracking system as list mail, for instance, you could say
        ``subscribe [0-9]*@bugs.guug.de''.  Often, it's sufficient to just
        give a portion of the list's e-mail address.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Specify as much of the address as you need to to remove ambiguity.  For
        example, if you've subscribed to the Mutt-ng mailing list, you will
        receive mail
        addressed to <emphasis>mutt-users@mutt.org</emphasis>.  So, to tell
        Mutt-ng that this is a
        mailing list, you could add ``lists mutt-users'' to your
        initialization file.  To tell mutt that you are subscribed to it,
        add ``subscribe mutt-users'' to your initialization file instead.
        If you also happen to get mail from someone whose address is
        <emphasis>mutt-users@example.com</emphasis>, you could use ``lists
        mutt-users@mutt\\.org'' 
        or ``subscribe mutt-users@mutt\\.org'' to
        match only mail from the actual list.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The ``unlists'' command is used to remove a token from the list of
        known and subscribed mailing-lists. Use ``unlists *'' to remove all
        tokens.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        To remove a mailing list from the list of subscribed mailing lists,
        but keep it on the list of known mailing lists, use ``unsubscribe''.

      <para>
        When encrypting messages with PGP or OpenSSL, you may want to associate
        a certain
        key with a given e-mail address automatically, either because the
        recipient's public key can't be deduced from the destination address,
        or because, for some reasons, you need to override the key Mutt-ng
        wouldnormally use.  The <muttng-doc:hook name="crypt"/> command provides a method by which
        you can
        specify the ID of the public key to be used when encrypting messages to
        a certain recipient.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The meaning of "key id" is to be taken broadly in this context:  You
        can either put a numerical key ID here, an e-mail address, or even
        just a real name.

        In situations where you have to cope with a lot of emails, e.g.
        when you read many different mailing lists, and take part in
        discussions, it is always useful to have the important messages
        marked and the annoying messages or the ones that you aren't
        interested in deleted. For this purpose, mutt-ng features a
        mechanism called ``scoring''.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        When you use scoring, every message has a base score of 0. You
        can then use the <literal>score</literal> command to define patterns
        and a
        positive or negative value associated with it. When a pattern
        matches a message, the message's score will be raised or lowered by
        the amount of the value associated with the pattern.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        
        <screen>
score "<muttng-doc:pattern name="f"/> nion@muttng\.org" 50
score "<muttng-doc:pattern name="f"/> @sco\.com" -100</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        If the pattern matches, it is also possible to set the score
        value of the current message to a certain value and then stop
        evaluation:
      </para>
      
      <para>
        
        <screen>
score "<muttng-doc:pattern name="f"/> santaclaus@northpole\.int" =666</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        What is important to note is that negative score values will be
        rounded up to 0.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        To make scoring actually useful, the score must be applied in
        some way.  That's what the <emphasis>score thresholds</emphasis> are
        for. Currently,
        there are three score thresholds:
      </para>
      
      <para>
        
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            
            <para>
              flag threshold: when a message has a score value equal or higher
              than the flag threshold, it will be flagged.
              
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            
            <para>
              read threshold: when a message has a score value equal or lower
              than the read threshold, it will be marked as read.
              
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            
            <para>
              delete threshold: when a message has a score value equal or
              lower than the delete threshold, it will be marked as deleted.
              
            </para>
          </listitem>
          
        </itemizedlist>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        These three thresholds can be set via the variables
        <muttng-doc:varref name="score-threshold-read"/>,
        <muttng-doc:varref name="score-threshold-flag"/> and
        <muttng-doc:varref name="score-threshold-delete"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
        By default,
        <muttng-doc:varref name="score-threshold-read"/> and
        <muttng-doc:varref name="score-threshold-delete"/> 
        are set to
        <literal>-1</literal>, which means that in the default threshold
        configuration no
        message will ever get marked as read or deleted.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Scoring gets especially interesting when combined with the <literal>
          color
        </literal>
        command
        and the <muttng-doc:pattern name="n"/> pattern:
      </para>
      
      <para>
        
        <screen>
color index  black   yellow  "<muttng-doc:pattern name="n"/> 10-"
color index  red     yellow  "<muttng-doc:pattern name="n"/> 100-"</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The rules above mark all messages with a score between 10 and 99
        with black and yellow, and messages with a score greater or equal
        100 with red and yellow. This might be unusual to you if you're used
        to e.g. slrn's scoring mechanism, but it is more flexible, as it
        visually marks different scores.

        Mutt-ng has generalized support for external spam-scoring filters.
        By defining your spam patterns with the <literal>spam</literal> and <literal>
          nospam
        </literal>
        commands, you can <emphasis>limit</emphasis>, <emphasis>search</emphasis>, and <emphasis>
          sort
        </emphasis>
        your
        mail based on its spam attributes, as determined by the external
        filter. You also can display the spam attributes in your index
        display using the <literal>%H</literal> selector in the
        <muttng-doc:varref name="index-format"/>
        variable. (Tip: try <literal>%?H?[%H] ?</literal>
        to display spam tags only when they are defined for a given message.)
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Your first step is to define your external filter's spam patterns using
        the <literal>spam</literal> command. <emphasis>pattern</emphasis>
        should be a regular expression
        that matches a header in a mail message. If any message in the mailbox
        matches this regular expression, it will receive a ``spam tag'' or
        ``spam attribute'' (unless it also matches a <literal>nospam</literal>
        pattern -- see
        below.) The appearance of this attribute is entirely up to you, and is
        governed by the <emphasis>format</emphasis> parameter. <emphasis>format</emphasis> can be any static
        text, but it also can include back-references from the <emphasis>
          pattern
        </emphasis>
        expression. (A regular expression ``back-reference'' refers to a
        sub-expression contained within parentheses.) <literal>%1</literal> is replaced with
        the first back-reference in the regex, <literal>%2</literal>
        with the second, etc.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        If you're using multiple spam filters, a message can have more than
        one spam-related header. You can define <literal>spam</literal>
        patterns for each
        filter you use. If a message matches two or more of these patterns, and
        the $spam_separator variable is set to a string, then the
        message's spam tag will consist of all the <emphasis>format</emphasis>
        strings joined
        together, with the value of $spam_separator separating
        them.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        For example, suppose I use DCC, SpamAssassin, and PureMessage. I might
        define these spam settings:
        
        <screen>
spam "X-DCC-.*-Metrics:.*(....)=many"         "90+/DCC-%1"
spam "X-Spam-Status: Yes"                     "90+/SA"
spam "X-PerlMX-Spam: .*Probability=([0-9]+)%" "%1/PM"
set spam_separator=", "</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        If I then received a message that DCC registered with ``many'' hits
        under the ``Fuz2'' checksum, and that PureMessage registered with a
        97% probability of being spam, that message's spam tag would
        read<literal>90+/DCC-Fuz2, 97/PM</literal>. (The four characters before
        ``=many'' in a
        DCC report indicate the checksum used -- in this case, ``Fuz2''.)
      </para>
      
      <para>
        If the $spam_separator variable is unset, then each
        spam pattern match supersedes the previous one. Instead of getting
        joined <emphasis>format</emphasis> strings, you'll get only the last
        one to match.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The spam tag is what will be displayed in the index when you use
        <literal>%H</literal> in the <literal>
          $index_format
        </literal>
        variable. It's also the
        string that the <muttng-doc:pattern name="H"/> pattern-matching expression
        matches against for
        <emphasis>search</emphasis> and <emphasis>limit</emphasis> functions.
        And it's what sorting by spam
        attribute will use as a sort key.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        That's a pretty complicated example, and most people's actual
        environments will have only one spam filter. The simpler your
        configuration, the more effective mutt can be, especially when it comes
        to sorting.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Generally, when you sort by spam tag, mutt will sort <emphasis>
          lexically
        </emphasis>
        --
        that is, by ordering strings alphnumerically. However, if a spam tag
        begins with a number, mutt will sort numerically first, and lexically
        only when two numbers are equal in value. (This is like UNIX's
        <literal>sort -n</literal>.) A message with no spam attributes at all
        -- that is, one
        that didn't match <emphasis>any</emphasis> of your <literal>spam</literal> patterns -- is sorted at
        lowest priority. Numbers are sorted next, beginning with 0 and ranging
        upward. Finally, non-numeric strings are sorted, with ``a'' taking
        lowerpriority than ``z''. Clearly, in general, sorting by spam tags is
        most
        effective when you can coerce your filter to give you a raw number. But
        in case you can't, mutt can still do something useful.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The <literal>nospam</literal> command can be used to write exceptions
        to <literal>spam</literal>
        patterns. If a header pattern matches something in a <literal>spam</literal> command,
        but you nonetheless do not want it to receive a spam tag, you can list
        amore precise pattern under a <literal>nospam</literal> command.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        If the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> given to <literal>nospam</literal>
        is exactly the same as the
        <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> on an existing <literal>spam</literal>
        list entry, the effect will be to
        remove the entry from the spam list, instead of adding an exception.
        Likewise, if the <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> for a <literal>spam</literal> command matches an entry
        on the <literal>nospam</literal> list, that <literal>nospam</literal>
        entry will be removed. If the
        <emphasis>pattern</emphasis> for <literal>nospam</literal> is ``*'', <emphasis>
          all entries on both lists
        </emphasis>
        will be removed. This might be the default action if you use <literal>
          spam
        </literal>
        and <literal>nospam</literal> in conjunction with a <muttng-doc:hook name="folder"/>.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        You can have as many <literal>spam</literal> or <literal>nospam</literal> commands as you like.
        You can even do your own primitive spam detection within mutt -- for
        example, if you consider all mail from <literal>MAILER-DAEMON</literal>
        to be spam,
        you can use a <literal>spam</literal> command like this:

      <para>

        There are four basic types of variables:
        boolean, number, string and quadoption.  <emphasis>boolean</emphasis>
        variables can be
        <emphasis>set</emphasis> (true) or <emphasis>unset</emphasis> (false). 
        <emphasis>number</emphasis> variables can be
        assigned a positive integer value.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        <emphasis>string</emphasis> variables consist of any number of
        printable characters.
        <emphasis>strings</emphasis> must be enclosed in quotes if they contain
        spaces or tabs.  You
        may also use the ``C'' escape sequences <emphasis role="bold">\n</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">
          \t
        </emphasis>
        for
        newline and tab, respectively.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        <emphasis>quadoption</emphasis> variables are used to control whether
        or not to be prompted
        for certain actions, or to specify a default action.  A value of <emphasis>
          yes
        </emphasis>
        will cause the action to be carried out automatically as if you had
        answered
        yes to the question.  Similarly, a value of <emphasis>no</emphasis>
        will cause the the
        action to be carried out as if you had answered ``no.''  A value of
        <emphasis>ask-yes</emphasis> will cause a prompt with a default answer
        of ``yes'' and
        <emphasis>ask-no</emphasis> will provide a default answer of ``no.''
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Prefixing a variable with ``no'' will unset it.  Example: <literal>set
          noaskbcc

        .
      </para>
      
      <para>
        For <emphasis>boolean</emphasis> variables, you may optionally prefix
        the variable name with
        <literal>inv</literal> to toggle the value (on or off).  This is useful
        when writing
        macros.  Example: <literal>set invsmart_wrap</literal>.

      <para>
        The <literal>toggle</literal> command automatically prepends the <literal>

      <para>
        Using the enter-command function in the <emphasis>index</emphasis>
        menu, you can query the
        value of a variable by prefixing the name of the variable with a
        question
        mark:

set ?allow_8bit</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The question mark is actually only required for boolean and quadoption 
        variables.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The <literal>reset</literal> command resets all given variables to the
        compile time
        defaults (hopefully mentioned in this manual). If you use the command
        <literal>set</literal> and prefix the variable with ``&amp;'' this has

        This command allows the inclusion of initialization commands

          As users may run mutt-ng on different systems, the configuration
          must be maintained because it's likely that people want to use the
          setup everywhere they use mutt-ng. And mutt-ng tries to help where it
          can.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          To not produce conflicts with different character sets, mutt-ng
          allows users to specify in which character set their configuration
          files are encoded. Please note that while reading the configuration
          files, this is only respected after the corresponding declaration
          appears. It's advised to put the following at the very beginning of a
          users muttngrc:
        </para>
        
        <para>

        </para>
        
        <para>
          and replacing the dots with the actual character set. To avoid
          problems while maintaining the setup, <muttng-doc:man name="vim"/> user's may want to use
          modelines as show in:

          while, again, replacing the dots with the appropriate name. This

          ``Modularization'' means to divide the setup into several files

          All available functions, variables and menus are documented
          elsewhere in this manual but ``features'' is specific to these
          two commands. To test for one, prefix one of the following
          keywords with <literal>feature_</literal>: ncurses,
          slang, iconv, idn, dotlock, standalone, pop, nntp, imap, ssl,

          As an example, one can use the following in

          built in.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          An example for testing for variable names can be used if users
          use different revisions of mutt-ng whereby the older one may not
          have a certain variable. To test for the availability of
          <muttng-doc:varref name="imap-mail-check"/>
          use:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
ifdef imap_mail_check 'set imap_mail_check = 300'</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Provided for completeness is the test for menu names. To set
          <muttng-doc:varref name="pager-index-lines"
           />
          only if the pager
          menu is available, use:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
ifdef pager 'set pager_index_lines = 10'</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          For completeness, too, the opposite of <literal>ifdef</literal> is
          provided:
          <literal>ifndef</literal> which only executes the command if the test
          fails. For
          example, the following two examples are equivalent:
        </para>

      <title>Regular Expressions</title>
      
      <para>
        All string patterns in Mutt-ng including those in more complex
        <link linkend="tab-patterns">patterns</link> must be specified
        using regular expressions (regexp) in the ``POSIX extended'' syntax
        (which
        is more or less the syntax used by egrep and GNU awk).  For your
        convenience, we have included below a brief description of this syntax.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The search is case sensitive if the pattern contains at least one upper
        case letter, and case insensitive otherwise. Note that ``\''
        must be quoted if used for a regular expression in an initialization
        command: ``\\''.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings.
        Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic
        expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller expressions.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Note that the regular expression can be enclosed/delimited by either
        &quot;
        or ' which is useful if the regular expression includes a white-space
        character.  See <link linkend="configuration-syntax">muttrc-syntax</link>
        for more information on &quot; and ' delimiter processing.  To match a
        literal &quot; or ' you must preface it with \ (backslash).
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The fundamental building blocks are the regular expressions that match
        a single character.  Most characters, including all letters and digits,
        are regular expressions that match themselves.  Any metacharacter with
        special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The period ``.'' matches any single character.  The caret ``^''
        andthe dollar sign ``$'' are metacharacters that respectively
        match
        the empty string at the beginning and end of a line.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        A list of characters enclosed by ``]'' and ``]'' matches any
        single character in that list; if the first character of the list
        is a caret ``^'' then it matches any character <emphasis role="bold">
          not
        </emphasis>
        in the
        list.  For example, the regular expression <emphasis role="bold">
          ]0123456789]
        </emphasis>
        matches any single digit.  A range of ASCII characters may be specified
        by giving the first and last characters, separated by a hyphen
        ``-''.  Most metacharacters lose their special meaning inside
        lists.  To include a literal ``]'' place it first in the list.
        Similarly, to include a literal ``^'' place it anywhere but first.
        Finally, to include a literal hyphen ``-'' place it last.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Certain named classes of characters are predefined.  Character classes
        consist of ``[:'', a keyword denoting the class, and ``:]''.

        Two additional special sequences can appear in character lists.  These
        apply to non-ASCII character sets, which can have single symbols
        (calledcollating elements) that are represented with more than one
        character,
        as well as several characters that are equivalent for collating or
        sorting purposes:

                A collating symbol is a multi-character collating element
                enclosed in
                ``[.'' and ``.]''.  For example, if ``ch'' is a
                collating
                element, then <emphasis role="bold">
                  [[.ch.]]
                </emphasis>
                is a regexp that matches
                this collating element, while <emphasis role="bold">
                  [ch]
                </emphasis>
                is a regexp that

                An equivalence class is a locale-specific name for a list of
                characters that are equivalent. The name is enclosed in
                ``[=''
                and ``=]''.  For example, the name ``e'' might be used to
                represent all of ``è'' ``é'' and ``e''.  In this
                case,
                <emphasis role="bold">[[=e=]]</emphasis> is
                a regexp that matches any of

        Mutt-ng's pattern language provides a simple yet effective way to
        set up rules to match messages, e.g. for operations like tagging and
        scoring. A pattern consists of one or more sub-pattern, which can be
        logically grouped, ORed, and negated. For a complete listing of
        these patterns, please refer to table <link linkend="tab-patterns">patterns</link> in the Reference chapter.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        It must be noted that in this table, <literal>EXPR</literal> is
        a regular expression. For ranges, the forms
        <literal>&lt;[MAX]</literal>, <literal>&gt;&#62;[MIN]</literal>,
        <literal> [MIN]-</literal> and <literal>-[MAX]</literal> are
        also possible.

      <sect2 id="patterns-complex">
        <title>Complex Patterns</title>
        
        <para>
          It is possible to combine several sub-patterns to a more complex
          pattern. The most simple possibility is to logically AND several
          patterns by stringing them together:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
<muttng-doc:pattern name="s"/> 'SPAM' <muttng-doc:pattern name="U"/></screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          The pattern above matches all messages that contain ``SPAM'' in
          the subject and are unread.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          To logical OR patterns, simply use the <literal>|</literal>
          operator. This one
          especially useful when using local groups:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
<muttng-doc:pattern name="f"/> ("nion@muttng\.org"|"ak@muttng\.org"|"pdmef@muttng\.org")

        </para>
        
        <para>
          The first pattern matches all messages that were sent by one of
          the mutt-ng maintainers, while the seconds pattern matches all
          messages that contain ``mutt-ng'' in the message body or ``Mutt-ng''
          in the subject. The third pattern matches all messages that do not
          contain ``@synflood\.at'' in the <literal>References:</literal>
          header, i.e.
          messages that are not an (indirect) reply to one of my messages. A
          pattern can be logicall negated using the <literal>!</literal>
          operator.
        </para>
        
      </sect2>
      
      <sect2 sect="patterns-dates">
        <title>Patterns and Dates</title>
        
        <para>
          When using dates in patterns, the dates must be specified in a
          special format, i.e.  <literal>DD/MM/YYYY</literal>. If you don't
          specify
          month or year, they default to the current month or year. When using
          date ranges, and you specify only the minimum or the maximum, the
          specified date will be excluded, e.g. <literal>01/06/2005-</literal>
          matches
          against all messages <emphasis>after</emphasis> Juni 1st, 2005.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          It is also possible to use so-called ``error margins'' when
          specifying date ranges.  You simply specify a date, and then the
          error margin. This margin needs to contain the information whether
          it goes ``forth'' or ``back'' in time, by using <literal>+</literal>
          and <literal>-</literal>.
          Then follows a number and a unit, i.e. <literal>y</literal> for
          years, <literal>m</literal> for
          months, <literal>w</literal> for weeks and <literal>d</literal> for
          days. If you use the special
          <literal>*</literal> sign, it means that the error margin goes to
          both``directions'' in time.
        </para>

        </para>
        
        <para>
          The first pattern matches all dates between January 1st, 2005 and
          January 1st 2006.  The second pattern matches all dates between
          October 18th, 2004 and October 4th 2004 (2 weeks before 18/10/2004),
          while the third pattern matches all dates 1 day around December
          28th, 2004 (i.e. Dec 27th, 28th and 29th).
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Relative dates are also very important, as they make it possible
          to specify date ranges between a fixed number of units and the
          current date. How this works can be seen in the following example:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
<muttng-doc:pattern name="d"/> &gt;2w # messages older than two weeks
<muttng-doc:pattern name="d"/> &lt;3d # messages newer than 3 days

        <para>
          The so called <emphasis>Format Strings</emphasis> offer great
          flexibility when
          configuring mutt-ng. In short, they describe what items to print
          out how in menus and status messages.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Basically, they work as this: for different menus and bars,
          there's a variable specifying the layout. For every item
          available, there is a so called <emphasis>expando</emphasis>.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          For example, when running mutt-ng on different machines or
          different versions for testing purposes, it may be interesting to
          have the following information always printed on screen when one
          is in the index:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              
              <para>
                the current hostname
                
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              
              <para>
                the current mutt-ng version number
                
              </para>
            </listitem>
            
          </itemizedlist>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          The setting for the status bar of the index is controlled via the
          <muttng-doc:varref name="status-format"/>
          variable. For the hostname and version string, there's an expando
          for <literal>$status_format</literal>: <literal>
            %h
          </literal>
          expands to the
          hostname and <literal>%v</literal> to the version string. When
          just configuring:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
set status_format = "%v on %h: ..."</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          mutt-ng will replace the sequence <literal>%v</literal> with
          the version string
          and <literal>%h</literal> with the host's name. When you are,
          for example, running
          mutt-ng version <literal>1.5.9i</literal> on host <literal>mailhost</literal>, you'll see the
          following when you're in the index:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
Mutt-ng 1.5.9i on mailhost: ...</screen>
          
        </para>

          To include the mailbox' name is as easy as:

          <screen>

        <para>

        <para>
          For the number of certain types of messages, one more feature of the
          format
          strings is extremely useful. If there aren't messages of a certain
          type, it
          may not be desired to print just that there aren't any but instead
          only
          print something if there are any.
        </para>

        <para>
          To only print the number of messages if there are new messages in
          the current mailbox, further extend
          <literal>$status_format</literal> to:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
set status_format = "%v on %h: %B %?n?%n new? ...</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          This feature is called <emphasis>nonzero-printing</emphasis> and
          works as this:
          some expandos may be optionally printed nonzero, i.e.  a portion
          of the format string is only evaluated if the value of the expando
          is different from zero. The basic syntax is:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
%?&#60;item&#62;?&#60;string if nonzero&#62;?</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          which tells mutt-ng to only look at <literal>&lt;string if
            nonzero&gt;
          </literal>
          if the value of the <literal>%&lt;item%gt;</literal>
          expando is different from zero. In our example, we used <literal>n</literal> as
          the expando to check for and <literal>%n new</literal> as the
          optional nonzero
          string.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          But this is not all: this feature only offers one alternative: 
          ``print something if not zero.'' Mutt-ng does, as you might guess, 
          also provide a logically complete version: ``if zero, print 
          something and else print something else.'' This is achieved by the 
          following syntax for those expandos which may be printed nonzero:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
%?&#60;item&#62;?&#60;string if nonzero&#62;&#38;&#60;string if zero&#62;?</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Using this we can make mutt-ng to do the following:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              
              <para>
                make it print ``<emphasis>n</emphasis> new messages'' whereby <emphasis>
                  n
                </emphasis>
                is the
                count but only if there new ones
                
              </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              
              <para>
                and make it print ``no new messages'' if there aren't any
                
              </para>
            </listitem>
            
          </itemizedlist>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          The corresponding configuration is:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
set status_format = "%v on %h: %B: %?n?%n new messages&amp;no new messages? ...</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          This doubles the use of the ``new messages'' string because it'll get
          always printed. Thus, it can be shortened to:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          
          <screen>
set status_format = "%v on %h: %B: %?n?%n&amp;no? new messages ...</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          As you might see from this rather simple example, one can create
          very complex but fancy status messages. Please see the reference
          chapter for expandos and those which may be printed nonzero.

                instead of
                just <literal>%&lt;item&gt;</literal>, mutt-ng will
                convert all
                characters in the expansion of <literal>&lt;item&gt;</literal>
                to
                lowercase.

                When specifying <literal>%:&lt;item&gt;</literal>
                instead of just
                <literal>%&lt;item&gt;</literal>, mutt-ng will convert
                all dots in the
                expansion of <literal>&lt;item&gt;</literal> to underscores
                (<literal>_</literal>).
                
              </para>
            </listitem>

        </para>
        
        <para>
          Also, there's a feature called <emphasis>Padding</emphasis> supplied
          by the
          following two expandos: <literal>%|X</literal> and <literal>
            %&gt;X
          </literal>
          .
        </para>
        
        <para>
          <variablelist>
            
            <varlistentry>
              <term>
                <literal>%|X</literal>
              </term>
              <listitem>
                <para>
                  When this occurs, mutt-ng will fill the
                  rest of the line with the character <literal>X</literal>. In
                  our example,
                  filling the rest of the line with dashes is done by setting:
                </para>
                
                <para>
                  
                  <screen>
set status_format = "%v on %h: %B: %?n?%n&amp;no? new messages %|-"</screen>
                  
                </para>
              </listitem>
            </varlistentry>
            <varlistentry>
              <term>
                <literal>%&gt;X</literal>
              </term>
              <listitem>
                <para>
                  Since the previous expando stops at
                  the end of line, there must be a way to fill the gap between
                  two items via the <literal>%&gt;X</literal> expando:
                  it puts as many
                  characters <literal>X</literal> in between two items so that
                  the rest of
                  the line will be right-justified. For example, to not put the
                  version string and hostname of our example on the left but on
                  the right and fill the gap with spaces, one might use (note
                  the space after <literal>%&gt;</literal>):

      <title>Using Tags</title>
      
      <para>
        Sometimes it is desirable to perform an operation on a group of
        messages all at once rather than one at a time.  An example might be
        to save messages to a mailing list to a separate folder, or to
        delete all messages with a given subject.  To tag all messages
        matching a pattern, use the tag-pattern function, which is bound to
        ``shift-T'' by default.  Or you can select individual messages by
        hand using the ``tag-message'' function, which is bound to ``t'' by
        default.  See <link linkend="tab-patterns">patterns</link> for Mutt-ng's
        pattern
        matching syntax.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Once you have tagged the desired messages, you can use the
        ``tag-prefix'' operator, which is the ``;'' (semicolon) key by default.
        When the ``tag-prefix'' operator is used, the <emphasis role="bold">
          next
        </emphasis>
        operation will
        be applied to all tagged messages if that operation can be used in that
        manner.  If the <muttng-doc:varref name="auto-tag"/>
        variable is set, the next operation applies to the tagged messages
        automatically, without requiring the ``tag-prefix''.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        In <muttng-doc:command name="macro"/> or <muttng-doc:command name="push"/> commands,
        you can use the ``tag-prefix-cond'' operator.  If there are no tagged
        messages, mutt will "eat" the rest of the macro to abort it's
        execution.Mutt-ng will stop "eating" the macro when it encounters the
        ``end-cond''
        operator;  after this operator the rest of the macro will be executed
        asnormal.

          sufficient.  But in dealing with messages a finer grain of control is
          needed for matching since for different purposes you want to match
          different criteria.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Mutt-ng allows the use of the <link linkend="tab-patterns">patterns</link>
          language for matching messages in hook commands.  This works in
          exactly the same way as it would when <emphasis>limiting</emphasis>
          or<emphasis>searching</emphasis> the mailbox, except that you are
          restricted to those
          operators which match information mutt extracts from the header of
          the message (i.e.  from, to, cc, date, subject, etc.).
        </para>
        
        <para>
          For example, if you wanted to set your return address based upon
          sending
          mail to a specific address, you could do something like:
          
          <screen>
send-hook '<muttng-doc:pattern name="t"/> ^me@cs\.hmc\.edu$' 'my-hdr From: Mutt-ng User &#60;user@host&#62;'</screen>
          
          which would execute the given command when sending mail to
          <emphasis>me@cs.hmc.edu</emphasis>.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          However, it is not required that you write the pattern to match using
          the
          full searching language.  You can still specify a simple <emphasis>
            regular
            expression
          </emphasis>
          like the other hooks, in which case Mutt-ng will translate your
          pattern into the full language, using the translation specified by
          the 
          <muttng-doc:hook name="default"/> variable.  The
          pattern is translated at the time the hook is declared, so the value
          of 
          <muttng-doc:hook name="default"/> that is in effect
          at that time will be used.

      <para>
        The sidebar, a feature specific to Mutt-ng, allows you to use a mailbox
        listing 
        which looks very similar to the ones you probably know from GUI mail
        clients.
        The sidebar lists all specified mailboxes, shows the number in each
        and highlights the ones with new email
        Use the following configuration commands:
        
        <screen>
set sidebar_visible="yes"
set sidebar_width=25</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        If you want to specify the mailboxes you can do so with:
        
        <screen>
set mbox='=INBOX'
mailboxes INBOX \
MBOX1 \
MBOX2 \
...</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        You can also specify the colors for mailboxes with new mails by using:
        
        <screen>
color sidebar_new red black
color sidebar white black</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Reasonable key bindings look e.g. like this:
        
        <screen>
bind index \Cp sidebar-prev
bind index \Cn sidebar-next
bind index \Cb sidebar-open
bind pager \Cp sidebar-prev
bind pager \Cn sidebar-next
bind pager \Cb sidebar-open

macro index B ':toggle sidebar_visible^M'
macro pager B ':toggle sidebar_visible^M'</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        You can then go up and down by pressing Ctrl-P and Ctrl-N, and 
        switch on and off the sidebar simply by pressing 'B'.

      <title>External Address Queries</title>
      
      <para>
        Mutt-ng supports connecting to external directory databases such as
        LDAP,
        ph/qi, bbdb, or NIS through a wrapper script which connects to mutt
        using a simple interface.  Using the
        <muttng-doc:varref name="query-command"/>
        variable, you specify the wrapper
        command to use.  For example:
      </para>
      
      <para>
        
        <screen>
set query_command = "mutt_ldap_query.pl '%s'"</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The wrapper script should accept the query on the command-line.  It
        should return a one line message, then each matching response on a
        single line, each line containing a tab separated address then name
        thensome other optional information.  On error, or if there are no
        matching
        addresses, return a non-zero exit code and a one line error message.

      </para>
      
      <para>
        There are two mechanisms for accessing the query function of mutt.  One
        is to do a query from the index menu using the query function (default:
        Q).
        This will prompt for a query, then bring up the query menu which will
        list the matching responses.  From the query menu, you can select
        addresses to create aliases, or to mail.  You can tag multiple
        addressesto mail, start a new query, or have a new query appended to
        the current
        responses.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The other mechanism for accessing the query function is for address
        completion, similar to the alias completion.  In any prompt for address
        entry, you can use the complete-query function (default: ^T) to
        run a
        query based on the current address you have typed.  Like aliases, mutt
        will look for what you have typed back to the last space or comma.  If
        there is a single response for that query, mutt will expand the address
        in place.  If there are multiple responses, mutt will activate the
        querymenu.  At the query menu, you can select one or more addresses to
        be
        added to the prompt.

        Mutt-ng supports reading and writing of four different mailbox formats:
        mbox, MMDF, MH and Maildir.  The mailbox type is autodetected, so there
        is no need to use a flag for different mailbox types.  When creating
        newmailboxes, Mutt-ng uses the default specified with the
        <muttng-doc:varref name="mbox-type"/>
        variable.

      <title>Handling Mailing Lists</title>
      
      <para>
        Mutt-ng has a few configuration options that make dealing with large
        amounts of mail easier.  The first thing you must do is to let Mutt
        know what addresses you consider to be mailing lists (technically
        this does not have to be a mailing list, but that is what it is most
        often used for), and what lists you are subscribed to.  This is
        accomplished through the use of the <muttng-doc:command name="lists"/>
        commands in your muttrc.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Now that Mutt-ng knows what your mailing lists are, it can do several
        things, the first of which is the ability to show the name of a list
        through which you received a message (i.e., of a subscribed list) in
        the <emphasis>index</emphasis> menu display.  This is useful to
        distinguish between
        personal and list mail in the same mailbox.  In the
        <muttng-doc:varref name="index-format"/>
        variable, the escape ``%L''
        will return the string ``To &lt;list&gt;'' when ``list'' appears in the
        ``To'' field, and ``Cc &lt;list&gt;'' when it appears in the ``Cc''
        field (otherwise it returns the name of the author).
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Often times the ``To'' and ``Cc'' fields in mailing list messages
        tend to get quite large. Most people do not bother to remove the
        author of the message they are reply to from the list, resulting in
        two or more copies being sent to that person.  The ``list-reply''
        function, which by default is bound to ``L'' in the <emphasis>index</emphasis> menu
        and <emphasis>pager</emphasis>, helps reduce the clutter by only
        replying to the
        known mailing list addresses instead of all recipients (except as
        specified by <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal>, see below).
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Mutt-ng also supports the <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header. 
        When you send
        a message to a list of recipients which includes one or several
        subscribed mailing lists, and if the <muttng-doc:varref name="followup-to"/>
        option is set, mutt will generate
        a Mail-Followup-To header which contains all the recipients to whom
        you send this message, but not your address. This indicates that
        group-replies or list-replies (also known as ``followups'') to this
        message should only be sent to the original recipients of the
        message, and not separately to you - you'll receive your copy through
        one of the mailing lists you are subscribed to.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Conversely, when group-replying or list-replying to a message which
        has a <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header, mutt will respect
        this header if
        the <muttng-doc:varref name="honor-followup-to"/>
        configuration
        variable is set.  Using list-reply will in this case also make sure
        that the reply goes to the mailing list, even if it's not specified
        in the list of recipients in the <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal>.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Note that, when header editing is enabled, you can create a
        <literal>Mail-Followup-To</literal> header manually.  Mutt-ng will only
        auto-generate
        this header if it doesn't exist when you send the message.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The other method some mailing list admins use is to generate a
        ``Reply-To'' field which points back to the mailing list address rather
        than the author of the message.  This can create problems when trying
        to reply directly to the author in private, since most mail clients
        will automatically reply to the address given in the ``Reply-To''
        field.  Mutt-ng uses the <muttng-doc:varref name="reply-to"/>
        variable to help decide which address to use.  If set to <emphasis>
          ask-yes
        </emphasis>
        or
        <emphasis>ask-no</emphasis>, you will be
        prompted as to whether or not you would like to use the address given
        inthe ``Reply-To'' field, or reply directly to the address given in the
        ``From'' field.  When set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis>, the ``Reply-To''
        field will be used when
        present.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The ``X-Label:'' header field can be used to further identify mailing
        lists or list subject matter (or just to annotate messages
        individually).  The <muttng-doc:varref name="index-format"/>
        variable's ``%y'' and
        ``%Y'' escapes can be used to expand ``X-Label:'' fields in the
        index, and Mutt-ng's pattern-matcher can match regular expressions to
        ``X-Label:'' fields with the ``<muttng-doc:pattern name="y"/>'' selector.  ``X-Label:'' is
        not a
        standard message header field, but it can easily be inserted by
        procmailand other mail filtering agents.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Lastly, Mutt-ng has the ability to <link linkend="sort">sort</link> the
        mailbox into
        <link linkend="threads">threads</link>.  A thread is a group of
        messages which all relate to the same
        subject.  This is usually organized into a tree-like structure where a
        message and all of its replies are represented graphically.  If you've
        ever
        used a threaded news client, this is the same concept.  It makes
        dealingwith large volume mailing lists easier because you can easily
        delete
        uninteresting threads and quickly find topics of value.

        Mutt-ng has the ability to dynamically restructure threads that are

          Some mailers tend to "forget" to correctly set the "In-Reply-To:" and

          discussions because Mutt-ng has not enough information to guess the
          correct

          You can fix this by tagging the reply, then moving to the parent
          message
          and using the ``link-threads'' function (bound to &#38; by default).
          The

        Polling for new mail is more expensive over POP3 than locally. For this

        <title>Authentication</title>
        
        <para>
          Mutt-ng supports four authentication methods with IMAP servers: SASL,
          GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, and LOGIN (there is a patch by Grant Edwards to add
          NTLM authentication for you poor exchange users out there, but it has
          yet to be integrated into the main tree). There is also support for
          the pseudo-protocol ANONYMOUS, which allows you to log in to a public
          IMAP server without having an account. To use ANONYMOUS, simply make
          your username blank or "anonymous".
        </para>
        
        <para>
          SASL is a special super-authenticator, which selects among several
          protocols
          (including GSSAPI, CRAM-MD5, ANONYMOUS, and DIGEST-MD5) the most
          secure
          method available on your host and the server. Using some of these
          methods
          (including DIGEST-MD5 and possibly GSSAPI), your entire session will
          be
          encrypted and invisible to those teeming network snoops. It is the
          best
          option if you have it. To use it, you must have the Cyrus SASL
          libraryinstalled on your system and compile mutt with the <emphasis>
            --with-sasl
          </emphasis>
          flag.

          Mutt-ng will try whichever methods are compiled in and available on

                username in

        Article headers are cached and can be loaded from a file when a

        sender, i.e. they allow for only one value which may not be what the
        user wants to send as the <literal>From:</literal> header. In this
        case, the variable
        <muttng-doc:varref name="smtp-envelope"/> may be used
        to set the envelope different from the <literal>From:</literal> header.

        If you happen to have accounts on multiple IMAP and/or POP servers,
        you may find managing all the authentication settings inconvenient and
        error-prone.  The <muttng-doc:hook name="account"/> command may help. This hook works like

      <title>Compressed folders Support (OPTIONAL)</title>
      
      <para>
        If Mutt-ng was compiled with compressed folders support (by running the
        <emphasis>configure</emphasis> script with the <emphasis>
          --enable-compressed
        </emphasis>
        flag), Mutt
        can open folders stored in an arbitrary format, provided that the user
        has a script to convert from/to this format to one of the accepted.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The most common use is to open compressed archived folders e.g. with
        gzip.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        In addition, the user can provide a script that gets a folder in an
        accepted format and appends its context to the folder in the
        user-defined format, which may be faster than converting the entire
        folder to the accepted format, appending to it and converting back to
        the user-defined format.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        There are three hooks defined (<muttng-doc:hook name="open"/>,
        <muttng-doc:hook name="close"/> and <muttng-doc:hook name="append"/>
        )which define commands to uncompress and compress
        a folder and to append messages to an existing compressed folder 
        respectively.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        For example:
      </para>
      
      <para>
        
        <screen>
open-hook \\.gz$ "gzip -cd %f &#62; %t" 
close-hook \\.gz$ "gzip -c %t &#62; %f"
append-hook \\.gz$ "gzip -c %t &#62;&#62; %f" </screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        You do not have to specify all of the commands. If you omit <muttng-doc:hook name="append"/>
        ,the folder will be open and
        closed again each time you will add to it. If you omit <muttng-doc:hook name="close"/>
        (or give empty command) , the
        folder will be open in the  mode. If you specify <muttng-doc:hook name="append"/>
        though you'll be able to append
        to the folder.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Note that Mutt-ng will only try to use hooks if the file is not in one
        of
        the accepted formats. In particular, if the file is empty, mutt
        supposes it is not compressed. This is important because it allows the
        use of programs that do not have well defined extensions. Just use
        &quot;.&quot; as a regexp. But this may be surprising if your
        compressing script produces empty files. In this situation, unset
        <muttng-doc:varref name="save-empty"/>
        ,so that the compressed file
        will be removed if you delete all of the messages.

    <title>Mutt-ng's MIME Support</title>
    
    <para>
      Quite a bit of effort has been made to make Mutt-ng the premier text-mode
      MIME MUA.  Every effort has been made to provide the functionality that
      the discerning MIME user requires, and the conformance to the standards
      wherever possible.  When configuring Mutt-ng for MIME, there are two
      extratypes of configuration files which Mutt-ng uses.  One is the
      <literal>mime.types</literal> file, which contains the mapping of file
      extensions to 
      IANA MIME types.  The other is the <literal>mailcap</literal> file, which
      specifies
      the external commands to use for handling specific MIME types.
    </para>
    
    <sect1 id="mime">
      <title>Using MIME in Mutt</title>
      
      <para>
        There are three areas/menus in Mutt-ng which deal with MIME, they are
        the
        pager (while viewing a message), the attachment menu and the compose
        menu.
      </para>

        <title>Viewing MIME messages in the pager</title>
        
        <para>
          When you select a message from the index and view it in the pager,
          Mutt
          decodes the message to a text representation.  Mutt-ng internally
          supports
          a number of MIME types, including <literal>text/plain, text/enriched,
            message/rfc822, and message/news
          </literal>
          .In addition, the export
          controlled version of Mutt-ng recognizes a variety of PGP MIME types,
          including PGP/MIME and application/pgp.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Mutt-ng will denote attachments with a couple lines describing them.
          These lines are of the form:
          
          <screen>
[-- Attachment #1: Description --]
[-- Type: text/plain, Encoding: 7bit, Size: 10000 --]</screen>
          
          Where the <literal>Description</literal> is the description or
          filename given for the
          attachment, and the <literal>Encoding</literal> is one of
          <literal>7bit/8bit/quoted-printable/base64/binary</literal>.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          If Mutt-ng cannot deal with a MIME type, it will display a message
          like:
          
          <screen>

          The default binding for <literal>view-attachments</literal> is `v',
          which displays the
          attachment menu for a message.  The attachment menu displays a list
          ofthe attachments in a message.  From the attachment menu, you can
          save,
          print, pipe, delete, and view attachments.  You can apply these
          operations to a group of attachments at once, by tagging the
          attachments
          and by using the ``tag-prefix'' operator.  You can also reply to the
          current message from this menu, and only the current attachment (or
          the
          attachments tagged) will be quoted in your reply.  You can view
          attachments as text, or view them using the mailcap viewer
          definition.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Finally, you can apply the usual message-related functions (like

          The compose menu is the menu you see before you send a message.  It
          allows you to edit the recipient list, the subject, and other aspects
          of your message.  It also contains a list of the attachments of your
          message, including the main body.  From this menu, you can print,
          copy,
          filter, pipe, edit, compose, review, and rename an attachment or a
          list of tagged attachments.  You can also modifying the attachment

        <para>
          The '-' denotes that Mutt-ng will delete the file after sending (or
          postponing, or canceling) the message.  It can be toggled with the
          <literal>toggle-unlink</literal> command (default: u).  The next
          field is the MIME
          content-type, and can be changed with the <literal>edit-type</literal> command
          (default: ^T).  The next field is the encoding for the
          attachment,
          which allows a binary message to be encoded for transmission on 7bit
          links.  It can be changed with the <literal>edit-encoding</literal>
          command
          (default: ^E).  The next field is the size of the attachment,
          rounded to kilobytes or megabytes.  The next field is the filename,
          which can be changed with the <literal>rename-file</literal> command
          (default: R).

        MIME Type configuration with <literal>mime.types</literal>

      <para>
        When you add an attachment to your mail message, Mutt-ng searches your
        personal mime.types file within <muttng-doc:envvar name="HOME"/> and then
        the system mime.types file at <literal>/usr/local/share/mutt/mime.types</literal> or
        <literal>/etc/mime.types</literal>
      </para>
      
      <para>
        The mime.types file consist of lines containing a MIME type and a space
        separated list of extensions.  For example:
        
        <screen>
application/postscript          ps eps
application/pgp                 pgp
audio/x-aiff                    aif aifc aiff</screen>
        
        A sample <literal>mime.types</literal> file comes with the Mutt-ng
        distribution, and
        should contain most of the MIME types you are likely to use.  
      </para>
      
      <para>
        If Mutt-ng can not determine the mime type by the extension of the file
        you
        attach, it will look at the file.  If the file is free of binary
        information, Mutt-ng will assume that the file is plain text, and mark
        it
        as <literal>text/plain</literal>.  If the file contains binary
        information, then Mutt-ng will
        mark it as <literal>application/octet-stream</literal>.  You can change
        the MIME
        type that Mutt-ng assigns to an attachment by using the <literal>
          edit-type
        </literal>
        command from the compose menu (default: ^T). The MIME type is
        actually a
        major mime type followed by the sub-type, separated by a '/'. 6 major
        types: application, text, image, video, audio, and model have been
        approved
        after various internet discussions. Mutt-ng recognises all of these if
        the 
        appropriate entry is found in the mime.types file. It also recognises
        other
        major mime types, such as the chemical type that is widely used in the 
        molecular modelling community to pass molecular data in various forms
        to 
        various molecular viewers. Non-recognised mime types should only be
        used 
        if the recipient of the message is likely to be expecting such
        attachments.

        MIME Viewer configuration with <literal>mailcap</literal>

      <para>
        Mutt-ng supports <muttng-doc:rfc num="1524"/> MIME Configuration, in particular the Unix
        specific format specified in Appendix A of the RfC.  This file format
        is commonly referred to as the mailcap format.  Many MIME compliant
        programs utilize the mailcap format, allowing you to specify handling
        for all MIME types in one place for all programs.  Programs known to
        use this format include Netscape, XMosaic, lynx and metamail.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        In order to handle various MIME types that Mutt-ng can not handle
        internally, Mutt-ng parses a series of external configuration files to
        find an external handler.  The default search string for these files
        is a colon delimited list set to
        
        <screen>
${HOME}/.mailcap:/usr/local/share/mutt/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/etc/mailcap:/usr/etc/mailcap:/usr/local/etc/mailcap</screen>
        
        where <muttng-doc:envvar name="HOME"/> is your home directory.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        In particular, the metamail distribution will install a mailcap file,
        usually as <literal>/usr/local/etc/mailcap</literal>, which contains
        some baseline
        entries.

      <sect2 id="mime-mailcap-basics">
        <title>The Basics of the mailcap file</title>
        
        <para>
          A mailcap file consists of a series of lines which are comments,
          blank,
          or definitions.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          A comment line consists of a # character followed by anything you
          want.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          A blank line is blank.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          A definition line consists of a content type, a view command, and any
          number of optional fields.  Each field of a definition line is
          dividedby a semicolon ';' character.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          The content type is specified in the MIME standard type/subtype
          method.
          For example,
          <literal>text/plain, text/html, image/gif,</literal>
          etc.  In addition, the mailcap format includes two formats for
          wildcards, one using the special '*' subtype, the other is the
          implicit
          wild, where you only include the major type.  For example, <literal>
            image/*
          </literal>
          ,or
          <literal>video,</literal> will match all image types and video types,
          respectively.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          The view command is a Unix command for viewing the type specified.
          There
          are two different types of commands supported. The default is to send
          the body of the MIME message to the command on stdin. You can change
          this behavior by using %s as a parameter to your view command.
          This will cause Mutt-ng to save the body of the MIME message to a
          temporary
          file, and then call the view command with the %s replaced by
          the name of the temporary file. In both cases, Mutt-ng will turn over
          the
          terminal to the view program until the program quits, at which time
          Mutt
          will remove the temporary file if it exists.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          So, in the simplest form, you can send a text/plain message to the
          external pager more on stdin:
          
          <screen>
text/plain; more</screen>
          
          Or, you could send the message as a file:
          
          <screen>
text/plain; more %s</screen>
          
          Perhaps you would like to use lynx to interactively view a text/html 
          message:
          
          <screen>
text/html; lynx %s</screen>
          
          In this case, lynx does not support viewing a file from stdin, so you
          must use the %s syntax.
          <emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> <emphasis>Some older versions
            of lynx contain a bug where they
            will check the mailcap file for a viewer for text/html.  They will
            find
            the line which calls lynx, and run it.  This causes lynx to
            continuously
            spawn itself to view the object.
          </emphasis>
        </para>
        
        <para>
          On the other hand, maybe you don't want to use lynx interactively,
          youjust want to have it convert the text/html to text/plain, then you
          can
          use:
          
          <screen>
text/html; lynx -dump %s | more</screen>
          
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Perhaps you wish to use lynx to view text/html files, and a pager on
          all other text formats, then you would use the following:
          
          <screen>
text/html; lynx %s
text/*; more</screen>
          
          This is the simplest form of a mailcap file.

        <title>Secure use of mailcap</title>
        
        <para>
          The interpretation of shell meta-characters embedded in MIME
          parameters
          can lead to security problems in general.  Mutt-ng tries to quote
          parameters
          in expansion of %s syntaxes properly, and avoids risky
          characters by
          substituting them, see the <muttng-doc:varref name="mailcap-sanitize"/>
          variable.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          Although mutt's procedures to invoke programs with mailcap seem to be
          safe, there are other applications parsing mailcap, maybe taking less
          care
          of it.  Therefore you should pay attention to the following rules:
        </para>
        
        <para>
          <emphasis>Keep the %-expandos away from shell quoting.</emphasis>
          Don't quote them with single or double quotes.  Mutt-ng does this for
          you, the right way, as should any other program which interprets
          mailcap.  Don't put them into backtick expansions.  Be highly careful
          with eval statements, and avoid them if possible at all.  Trying to
          fix
          broken behaviour with quotes introduces new leaks - there is no
          alternative to correct quoting in the first place.
        </para>
        
        <para>
          If you have to use the %-expandos' values in context where you
          need
          quoting or backtick expansions, put that value into a shell variable
          and reference the shell variable where necessary, as in the following
          example (using <literal>$charset</literal> inside the backtick
          expansion is safe,
          since it is not itself subject to any further expansion):

            In addition to the required content-type and view command fields,
            you
            can add semi-colon ';' separated fields to set flags and other
            options.
            Mutt-ng recognizes the following optional fields:
            <variablelist>
              
              <varlistentry>
                <term>copiousoutput</term>
                <listitem>
                  <para>
                    This flag tells Mutt-ng that the command passes possibly
                    large amounts of
                    text on stdout.  This causes Mutt-ng to invoke a pager
                    (either the internal
                    pager or the external pager defined by the pager variable)
                    on the output
                    of the view command.  Without this flag, Mutt-ng assumes
                    that the command
                    is interactive.  One could use this to replace the pipe to <literal>
                      more
                    </literal>
                    in the <literal>lynx -dump</literal> example in the Basic
                    section:
                    
                    <screen>
text/html; lynx -dump %s ; copiousoutput</screen>
                    
                    This will cause lynx to format the text/html output as
                    text/plain
                    and Mutt-ng will use your standard pager to display the
                    results.

                    %s in the
                    command fields.  Certain programs will require a certain
                    file extension,
                    for instance, to correctly view a file.  For instance, lynx
                    will only
                    interpret a file as <literal>text/html</literal> if the
                    file ends in <literal>.html</literal>.
                    So, you would specify lynx as a <literal>text/html</literal> viewer with a line in
                    the mailcap file like:
                    
                    <screen>
text/html; lynx %s; nametemplate=%s.html</screen>

                  <para>
                    This field specifies a command to run to test whether this
                    mailcap
                    entry should be used.  The command is defined with the
                    command expansion
                    rules defined in the next section.  If the command returns
                    0, then the
                    test passed, and Mutt-ng uses this entry.  If the command
                    returns non-zero,
                    then the test failed, and Mutt-ng continues searching for
                    the right entry.
                    <emphasis role="bold">Note:</emphasis> <emphasis>the
                      content-type must match before Mutt-ng performs the test.

                    For example:
                    
                    <screen>
text/html; netscape -remote 'openURL(%s)' ; test=RunningX
text/html; lynx %s</screen>
                    
                    In this example, Mutt-ng will run the program RunningX
                    which will return 0
                    if the X Window manager is running, and non-zero if it
                    isn't.  If
                    RunningX returns 0, then Mutt-ng will call netscape to
                    display the
                    text/html object.  If RunningX doesn't return 0, then
                    Mutt-ng will go on
                    to the next entry and use lynx to display the text/html
                    object.

            When searching for an entry in the mailcap file, Mutt-ng will
            search for
            the most useful entry for its purpose.  For instance, if you are
            attempting to print an <literal>image/gif</literal>, and you have
            the following
            entries in your mailcap file, Mutt-ng will search for an entry with
            the
            print command:
            
            <screen>
image/*;        xv %s

            Mutt-ng will skip the <literal>image/*</literal> entry and use the <literal>
              image/gif
            </literal>
            entry with the print command.
          </para>

            In addition, you can use this with <muttng-doc:command name="auto-view"/>
            to denote two commands for viewing an attachment, one to be viewed
            automatically, the other to be viewed interactively from the
            attachment
            menu.  In addition, you can then use the test feature to determine
            which
            viewer to use interactively depending on your environment.
            
            <screen>

            For <muttng-doc:command name="auto-view"/>, Mutt-ng will choose
            the third
            entry because of the copiousoutput tag.  For interactive viewing,
            Mutt
            will run the program RunningX to determine if it should use the
            first
            entry.  If the program returns non-zero, Mutt-ng will use the
            second entry
            for interactive viewing.

      <para>
        In addition to explicitly telling Mutt-ng to view an attachment with
        theMIME viewer defined in the mailcap file, Mutt-ng has support for
        automatically viewing MIME attachments while in the pager.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        To work, you must define a viewer in the mailcap file which uses the 
        <literal>copiousoutput</literal> option to denote that it is
        non-interactive.
        Usually, you also use the entry to convert the attachment to a text
        representation which you can view in the pager.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        You then use the <literal>auto_view</literal> muttrc command to
        list the
        content-types that you wish to view automatically.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        For instance, if you set auto_view to:

image/gif application/x-tar-gz</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Mutt-ng could use the following mailcap entries to automatically view
        attachments of these types.
        
        <screen>
text/html;      lynx -dump %s; copiousoutput; nametemplate=%s.html

      <para>
        ``unauto_view'' can be used to remove previous entries from the
        autoview list.
        This can be used with <muttng-doc:hook name="message"/> to autoview messages based on size,
        etc.
        ``unauto_view *'' will remove all previous entries.

      <title>MIME Multipart/Alternative</title>
      
      <para>
        Mutt-ng has some heuristics for determining which attachment of a
        multipart/alternative type to display.  First, mutt will check the 
        alternative_order list to determine if one of the available
        typesis preferred.  The alternative_order list consists of a
        number of
        MIME types in order, including support for implicit and explicit
        wildcards, for example:
        
        <screen>
alternative_order text/enriched text/plain text
application/postscript image/*</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Next, mutt will check if any of the types have a defined 
        <muttng-doc:command name="auto-view"/>, and use that.  Failing
        that, Mutt-ng will look for any text type.  As a last attempt, mutt
        willlook for any type it knows how to handle.
      </para>

      <title>MIME Lookup</title>
      
      <para>
        Mutt-ng's mime_lookup list specifies a list of mime-types that
        should not
        be treated according to their mailcap entry.  This option is designed
        todeal with binary types such as application/octet-stream.  When an
        attachment's
        mime-type is listed in mime_lookup, then the extension of the
        filename will
        be compared to the list of extensions in the mime.types file.  The
        mime-type
        associated with this extension will then be used to process the
        attachment
        according to the rules in the mailcap file and according to any other
        configuration
        options (such as auto_view) specified.  Common usage would be:
        
        <screen>
mime_lookup application/octet-stream application/X-Lotus-Manuscript</screen>
        
      </para>
      
      <para>
        In addition, the unmime_lookup command may be used to disable
        this feature
        for any particular mime-type if it had been set, for example, in a
        global
        muttrc.

      by changing mutt-ng's configuration files: it then can execute

          existing header fields or attach arbitrary files. This may be

          the user, especially when they are called automatically (and

          Besides the mailcap mechanism, mutt-ng uses a number of other
          external utilities for operation.

          The same security considerations apply for these as for tools
          involved via mailcap (for example, mutt-ng is vulnerable to Denial
          of Service Attacks with compressed folders support if the
          uncompressed mailbox is too large for the disk it is saved to.)

        Mutt-ng also supports a ``batch'' mode to send prepared messages. 
        Simply redirect
        input from the file you wish to send.  For example,
      </para>
      
      <para>
        <literal>mutt -s &quot;data set for run #2&quot;
          professor@bigschool.edu

      </para>
      
      <para>
        This command will send a message to ``professor@bigschool.edu'' with a
        subject
        of ``data set for run #2''.  In the body of the message will be the
        contents
        of the file ``~/run2.dat''.

        made when using regular expressions inside of patterns.  Specifically,
        Mutt-ng's parser for these patterns will strip one level of backslash
        (\),
        which is normally used for quoting.  If it is your intention to use a
        backslash in the regular expression, you will need to use two
        backslashes
        instead (\\).
