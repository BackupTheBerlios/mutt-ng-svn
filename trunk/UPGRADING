This documents describes changes

  - made to configuration variables, functions and the like which are
    not backwards-compatible and/or which do not exist in mutt

  - other changes which might break existing user configuration and thus
    have to be documented

This document is not the place for verbose documentation; it only offers
the necessary keywords to look them up in the manual, ChangeLog or other
sources of information.

Note: as development goes fast and as documentation is way behind it,
this still likely is incomplete. Please report missing items to
<mutt-ng-devel@lists.berlios.de>
