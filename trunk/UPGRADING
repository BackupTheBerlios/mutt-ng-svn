This documents describes changes

  - made to configuration variables, functions and the like which are
    not backwards-compatible and/or which do not exist in mutt

  - other changes which might break existing user configuration and thus
    have to be documented

This document is not the place for verbose documentation; it only offers
the necessary keywords to look them up in the manual, ChangeLog or other
sources of information.

2005-10-09:

  The "attachments" and "unattachments" commands were added. The %X
  expando has been added to $index_format. The ~X pattern has been
  added. The %Q and %X expandos have been added to $attach_format. For
  better control purpose, the $count_attachments variable has been
  added, too.

  As part of the above addition(s), the 'A' message status flag has been
  removed again.

2005-10-07:

  When upgrading to after a revision after 528, header caches must be
  completely removed and rebuild again. From r540 on, this problem is
  solved so manual interaction will not be necessary any longer.

2005-09-14:

  The $smtp_envelope_from variable has been removed in favor of the
  general $envelope_from_address.

  The $envelope_from option has been renamed to $use_envelope_from.

2005-09-07:

  SASL 1.x support has been removed.

  All patterns may be prefixed with = instead of ~ to enable
  string search instead of regular expression match.

2005-09-03:

2005-08-31:

  $muttng_pwd, $muttng_folder_name, $muttng_folder_path.

2005-08-29:

  Several pre-defined read-only variables named $muttng_ have
  been added; this feature is maybe subject to change in the near
  future.

  The $editor_headers option has been added.

  The %Z expando of $index_format now also includes an 'A'
  as the last character if a mail has attachments, i.e. is of
  type multipart and a space otherwise. In addition, the ~M
  pattern was added to match these messages.

  Many synonym variables pointing to proper $nntp_ ones have
  been removed.

2005-08-27:

  The $debug_level option has been added.

  It's now possible to define and use arbitrary self-defined
  variables as long as prefixed with user_.

  The $user_agent variable had to be renamed to $agent_string.

  To keep consistency, the -D option has been removed again in
  favor of -T and -t.

2005-08-25:

  Instead of only supporting to expand environment variables via
  $NAME, it's now possible to query for all variables, too, e.g.
  'set imap_home_namespace = $folder'.

  The $abort_noattach and $attach_remind_regexp options have been
  added to remind users of possibly forgotten attachments.

2005-08-23:

  The $delete_space option has been added.

2005-08-22:

  $ssl_force_tls option.

2005-08-07:

  For $sidebar_number_format, the expandos %c and %f are replaced with
  their $status_format pendants %m and %F respectively. Use of %c and
  %f is deprecated but still kept for compatibility.

2005-08-06:

  Due to merging in changes made to mutt where NSS support was dropped,
  it's dropped in mutt-ng too.

2005-07-28:

  Because of reverting a (overly eager) mutt-ng-specific issue with
  header caching, starting with revision 362, all caches must be removed
  and rebuild again. Sorry for that.

  Due to changes to internal structures introduced in SVN revision 344,
  all header caches must be removed and rebuild.

  The '^' shortcut pointing to the current folder is no longer
  only available in muttng as it has been integrated into mutt, too.

2005-07-16:

  The 'prepare' script has been renamed to 'autogen.sh' as this name
  seems to be used in many projects using the autotools too.

2005-06-16:

  Pine compatibility for naming IMAP mailboxes has been removed, only
  the common imap[s]:// syntax remains.

  replacements for the next round are: ask_followup_to ->
  nntp_ask_followup_to, ask_x_comment_to -> nntp_ask_x_comment_to,
  catchup_newsgroup -> nntp_catchup, followup_to_poster ->
  nntp_followup_to_poster, group_index_format ->
  nntp_group_index_format, inews -> nntp_inews, mime_subject ->
  nntp_mime_subject, news_cache_dir -> nntp_cache_dir, news_server ->
  nntp_host, newsrc -> nntp_newsrc, nntp_poll -> nntp_mail_check,
  pop_checkinterval -> pop_mail_check, post_moderated ->
  nntp_post_moderated, save_unsubscribed -> nntp_save_unsubscribed,
  show_new_news -> nntp_show_new_news, show_only_unread ->
  nntp_show_only_unread, x_comment_to -> nntp_x_comment_to. Please use
  the contrib/update-config.pl script to update.

  Due to frequent trouble, $imap_mail_check now defaults to 300 seconds
  (5 minutes) rather than 5 seconds.

  The configuration variable $strict_mailto has been added.
