This documents describes changes

  - made to configuration variables, functions and the like which are
    not backwards-compatible and/or which do not exist in mutt

  - other changes which might break existing user configuration and thus
    have to be documented

This document is not the place for verbose documentation; it only offers
the necessary keywords to look them up in the manual, ChangeLog or other
sources of information.

2005-08-22:

  Reading configurations from ~/.muttngrc-$version and
  ~/.muttng/muttngrc-$version is no longer supported;

2005-08-18:

  The $max_display_recips option has been added.

2005-08-13:

  their $status_format pendants %m and %F respectively. Use of %c and
  %f is deprecated but still kept for compatibility.

2005-08-06:

  Due to merging in changes made to mutt where NSS support was dropped,
  it's dropped in mutt-ng too.

2005-07-28:

  Because of reverting a (overly eager) mutt-ng-specific issue with
  header caching, starting with revision 362, all caches must be removed
  and rebuild again. Sorry for that.

2005-07-25:

  Due to changes to internal structures introduced in SVN revision 344,
  all header caches must be removed and rebuild.

  The '-D' command line option has been added.

  Editing threads functionality is no longer only available
  in muttng as it has been integrated into mutt, too.

2005-07-24:

  The $xterm_leave option has been added.

  The '^' shortcut pointing to the current folder is no longer
  only available in muttng as it has been integrated into mutt, too.

2005-07-16:

  The 'prepare' script has been renamed to 'autogen.sh' as this name
  seems to be used in many projects using the autotools too.

2005-06-16:

  Pine compatibility for naming IMAP mailboxes has been removed, only
  the common imap[s]:// syntax remains.

  The first "round" of removing synonym variables is completed. The
  replacements for the next round are: ask_followup_to ->
  nntp_ask_followup_to, ask_x_comment_to -> nntp_ask_x_comment_to,
  catchup_newsgroup -> nntp_catchup, followup_to_poster ->
  nntp_followup_to_poster, group_index_format ->
  nntp_group_index_format, inews -> nntp_inews, mime_subject ->
  nntp_mime_subject, news_cache_dir -> nntp_cache_dir, news_server ->
  nntp_host, newsrc -> nntp_newsrc, nntp_poll -> nntp_mail_check,
  pop_checkinterval -> pop_mail_check, post_moderated ->
  nntp_post_moderated, save_unsubscribed -> nntp_save_unsubscribed,
  show_new_news -> nntp_show_new_news, show_only_unread ->
  nntp_show_only_unread, x_comment_to -> nntp_x_comment_to. Please use
  the contrib/update-config.pl script to update.

  Due to frequent trouble, $imap_mail_check now defaults to 300 seconds
  (5 minutes) rather than 5 seconds.

  The configuration variable $strict_mailto has been added.

2005-05-17:
